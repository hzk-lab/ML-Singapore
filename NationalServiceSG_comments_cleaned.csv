possible but the closer you get to sub 8 it will become exponentially harder heres some things you can do training run at least six days a week be vigilant about your body so never push your body if somewhere hurts when you stand or walk take one or two days off if that happens and stretch gently now for my training schedule you can adjust based off your fitness and lifestyle before long and easy runs do a 800 meter warm up then static stretches and then dynamic stretches ask if you want the specifics before workouts same warm up as above but lengthen dynamics and do a progression before track interval workouts depending on your physical condition try a 4 minute 6 minute or 9 minute progression it can look like 112 222 or 333 at paces 440420400 minute per km monday hard workout usually a double tempo in the morning 57 km at a consistent fast pace ex 345 minuteperkm mpkm then afternoon late afternoon intervals on the track depending on what you think you need to work on speed 1620 200meters in sets of four so you do one walkjog back up to the starting line then do 4x200 meters and take a 230300 minute recovery and go again until 16 or 20 200 meters total mental one close to all out 800 meter lets say your pb is 230 youll be running 235240 23 1km fartlek fast on the first 200 meter then ten seconds slower on the next 200 meter and repeat until you do 3x200 meter fast and 2x200 slow ex 35 fast then 45 slow then 2x600 meters these can either be like the fartlek fast slow fast or a consistent pace ex 500 mpkm flat go 34 minutes recovery on this and a minute less on the 600 meters this is terrible you will dread going on the starting line right after the 800 meter but push through and every time you do this workout youll realize you have the ability to never stop never give in to tireness youll be faster sharper and even more mentally strong pacing 4x800 8x400 or a mix of both 2x800 4x400 good if you want to be consistent racing the 24 km you have to hit set paces on every repetition with short recovery 1 to 225 minutes ex 230 consistent on the 800s 69 consistent on 400s tuesday long run walk jog pace try to keep it consistent and avoid stopping as much as possible ex 810 km at 500 mpkm wednesday either easier workout or long run depending on your soreness thursday have to do a workout by today or you can tune up for a race on saturday basically run 200 meters at your 24 km race pace ex 6x200 at 35 seconds pace which is 700 flat on 24k helps you get a feel for your paces friday easy very easy run 5km max or dont even run at all take it chill stretch and recover saturday either join an official 24k and test your fitness or do a 24k race on your own and get into the zone to run your hardest try to pb everytime you do this but if you dont pb in 23 weeks intervals during your months of training thats completely fine the training is settling in and push hard and itll be worth it sunday my coach would always say if you ran a good race put your legs up meaning youve worked hard this week and deserve the rest i like seeing the sunrise so i will always go on an easy bike ride on these days but honestly if you believe youve worked hard which your mind and body will know rest up and get ready for monday nutrition try not to eat so much processed food once a week or so is okay but it really is horrible for your health im talking about fast food excess of processed sugars candies and things like that i do love using fruits raw honey and real maple syrup for my carbohydrates though they have micronutrients prebiotics and minerals that definitely benefit you electrolytes drink a serving 1000 mg of salt youll need it get one with magnesium as well either in the morning or 12 hours before running working out some days youll need two or even three servings depending on how hard you work especially mondays so if you feel dehydrated get some electrolytes in sleep the most important part of running if you run so hard and dont get good sleep it is a straight path to injury make sure you get eight hours of restful sleep a night it is amazing and even when tough or give up starts to creep in your sleep will give your body enough rest to push through that mental and running partners a lot of my mental to run has been built by my teammates i absolutely appreciate and am grateful to them when you understand that your teammate will never slow down and let go of your pace you will never let go try to find like minded people to push your physical limits with if not you must find it in yourself why do you want to run this goal what is your purpose how bad do you really want this are you ready to get into a dark place where you will have to suffer more than other people to achieve this if no build it you can do it realizing you can go through things that suck is so gratifying and if yes your mental is ready go out and get it everytime you finish something difficult the next time youre even less likely to give up build ambition a fire that can burn the whole forest down you got this ask if you need anything else clarification or specifics i believe in your grit and efforts thank you for reaching out and trying to
