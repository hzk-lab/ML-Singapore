PCMe BCC/B , PW- A, GP- B 75rp
 i‚Äôm afraid i won‚Äôt be able to get into uni because ill be rejected from every course im interested in:


NUS: CHS first choice with the bonus 2.5rp into physics (77.5rp), is that a long shot? Or should i just try for NUS engineering as first choice instead?

SMU: will i be able to get into Information systems or Business (selected interview maybe?)

NTU: where can i ABA into that is within my reach? I have a good leadership CCA portfolio. Not really sure where i can go in NTU even after looking at the IGP and wanting a good future. I don‚Äôt think computer science or computer eng will be possible for me to get into? 

my main concern is my C in math affecting my choices idk

CCC/B, GP C, PW A

1. NTU mathematical sciences (min 72.5rp)
would this be possible with H2 Math C? i‚Äôve always had strong passion for math in school and pretty much my entire 12 years of MOE education but i have no idea how my C shows that (i got A for small tests the entirety of JC)

I also wanted to ask if anyone knew the job prospects of this course cuz i keep thinking you can only be a math teacher but my friends are telling me otherwise

2. NTU chem and bio chem (min 70rp)
honestly i‚Äôm just afraid these courses won‚Äôt take me because my grades are all C for these so is this possible? i‚Äôm only against this because the starting pay is reportedly really low‚Ä¶.but i don‚Äôt really have a choice

3. not a course, just a question
NTU application form allows u to fill in your choices and all, and assuming i indicate ‚ÄúMathematical Sciences with a Minor in Finance‚Äù a popup below my 5 choices indicates ‚Äúmy application will also be considered for Mathematical Sciences‚Äù

does this mean mathematical science automatically becomes one of the courses i ‚Äúso called‚Äù applied for or is there a chance they will reject me immediately bc my score is too low to take a course with a minor in finance?

4. also another question
NUS and NTU both have aptitude based admission (ABA), which NTU application form very clearly states a component will be provided if a candidate wants to attempt admission by ABA, but NUS ABA website has no separate application from whatsoever and neither is it in the main application form where we input all our courses. anyone has any idea how we can gain admission by ABA into NUS? is there a separate form or do they just assume ABA via our responses in the main application form?

5. additional
wanted to ask about the IGP given by each uni, by stating 10th percentile, are unis indicating the lowest score that the course has admitted in the past academic year or just the 10th lowest score and it‚Äôs possible people with lower scores could‚Äôve been admitted? so even if i don‚Äôt meet the cop rp i have a chance of getting in?",7,1740181943.0,phama_tic_6164,SGExams

‚úÖ Strong in theoretical problem-solving, deduction, and creative thinking. (Great at studying econ's causal links)

‚úÖ Prefer a more general degree so as to not lock myself to a single industry as I still am not sure what I want to do.

‚úÖ Prefer STEM over business/finance, but open to interdisciplinary fields. 

‚úÖ Dislike pure memorization and prefer understanding concepts deeply. (Having to memorise physics formulae was tough for me)

‚úÖ Value passion-driven fields and small teams over corporate ladder climbing.

‚úÖ Want a good-paying job but avoid extremely competitive/overcrowded fields.

‚úÖ NTU preferred over NUS due to better hall life and a more relaxed environment.

Should be alright for NTU Math because in the past, there are NTU Math students with A Level H2 Math C, and their RP is in the low 70s range. Uni math in a math major (more math proof/argument based) is quite different from JC Math (more calculation based). Thus, there are many instances of people not doing very well in H2 Math, but manage to do well in uni math in a math major.

For your case of borderline the 10th percentile RP, you should do ABA, and importantly mention your strong passion in math, and list all the math competitions that you have participated in.

# Strong Job Prospects of NTU Math degree graduates

Rest assured on the good future job prospect of NTU math degree graduates. You can read my post (link below) where I wrote about some examples of where NTU math degree graduates go. From Statistician in Department of Stats (DOS), Singapore, to Data/AI Engineer in Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), to cybersecurity roles in CSIT/Govtech and other tech/IT firms, to researchers in A\*STAR/DSO and further studies (masters/phd) in quantitative fields (such as math/stats/CS/econs/finance/engineering).

Above link also provides another link below that¬†gives a detailed breakdown on the percentage of NTU Math graduates who went to take on jobs in various sectors and their common job titles.¬†A math degree is definitely not destined to only become math teachers.

3. It should mean ""mathematical science automatically becomes one of the courses i ‚Äúso called‚Äù applied for"". The rationale is to avoid applicants having to list down so many variants (paired with different minors or not) of the same degree course.

5. Is 10th percentile. So there are students with lower RP getting in, likely via ABA.",5,1740189988.0,math_dydx,SGExams

Start narrowing down your search of uni degree course that best suits u by analysing your strengths/aptitude. What subject(s) u tend to do well in school?

I don't think convincing your mother to completely change her mind and allow you to take poly course is possible atp. Judging by ur backstories, its evident ur mother is quite firm on her beliefs (and quite controlling in that aspect too). Managing to gain her temporary ""approval"" is likely not a viable solution, either, as from prior experience people like this are likely going to turn their backs on the previously-made deal and play with the conditions/words, trapping you in another unfavourable situation.

  
I second Eclair77's suggestions. Try to garner as much support from your lecturers, teachers, councillors even, and see if they can step in and negotiate a deal with your mother. That way, if she does turn her back on the deal, at least you have a network backing you up. For now, I'd advice you to follow where your heart and put effort into what you genuinely like/are passionate about. Should you find interest in polytechnic, then put in maximal effort in your courses. Do weigh your  options, however - if you fail to come up with a suitable solution by June, do consider reallocating your effort and attention.

1) You are absolutely absolutely certain u want to be in public sector/stat board u r affliated to. Again, even if you are, not taking the scholarship can still allow u to get into public sector
2) your major‚Äôs jobs prospects will be in the public sector anyway. This could be majors like geography or public policy, do some research.
3) you are going overseas and cannot afford tuition. BUT imo, taking loans is a very valid option especially if u r going into highly paid fields like high finance that can pay 200k+ a year, there is a better ROI, but consider if you want to start your working life in that much debt. So so so many scholars want to break bond because they see theres better job opportunities in these fields but find themselves 1M+ in debt (more than wat they have to pay initially due to high interest) and stuck in the public service. Pls do not be that person. If ur family income doesnt qualify for enough loans, maybe then consider scholarships

as to which scholarship is best for you, it depends on wat career u want to be in, but if u r doing local, i think it is the most foolish mistake to take up scholarships, unless you fall under reason 2 above. paying local fees can be done via part time jobs (eg teaching 3-4 students tuition shld be sufficient) or taking loans which isnt even that much + theres no interest until u start working. Numbers wise, an average working salary is 60k per year and ur tuition would be 40-50k a year, u can easily pay the debt off in less than 5 years and have alot left to spend",23,1744339465.0,Own-Studio-7695,SGExams

Depends though. Not for HDB or URA lah, but some sectors like security/defence are difficult to enter later on. Anyway, if you're truthfully interested in building a career in public service, then going on a scholarship is far more preferable than being a non-scholar in terms of CEP/LP and progression.

>i think it is the most foolish mistake to take up scholarships, unless you fall under reason 2 above.

I'd say reason 1 still okay. It's 4 year bond for local instead of 6 for overseas. And you it's sliced as you serve through the bond; if you start work with the expectation of leaving than clearly you made a silly choice to begin with.

And ofc again, it's better to join a local scholar than a farmer. You don't want to hentak kaki forever.

But thinking from a top down approach. If you are BMTC Commander (COL).

You let 40% book out for interviews. The rest of the 30% wants to do it too.

Firstly, I want to express how glad I am that you‚Äôre making this post, as a call for help. I can assume your intent is to get over the mental suffering by asking others to be more empathetic. I also did the same, as well as getting on antidepressants & therapy. My environment did improve somewhat, and I managed to improve from that severe, ‚Äúactive‚Äù depression to a milder, ‚Äúpassive‚Äù depression. I couldn‚Äôt eliminate my depression but I did gain an awareness that depression isn‚Äôt my neutral mental state, the ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù that I‚Äôve associated it with. 

I remember reading up on Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Dostoevsky to gain a philosophical understanding of my depression, but it actually ended up digging a deeper hole so yeah haha‚Ä¶ lol. After a resulting depressive period in life that lasted for months I decided to move on to reading about therapy. Specifically cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). 

**Disclaimer: YMMV with helping yourself using therapy frameworks. It could exacerbate your depression! Best to consult with a professional before attempting this!**

A key thing I discovered about (my) depression from reading about CBT is that at the root, it‚Äôs a *mental disorder, not a mood disorder*. My cognitions(way of thinking) affect my mood, not the other way around. It really illuminated how I got misattributed the cause & effect of depression. 

Once we understand this cognitions‚Äî> feelings process, we can then plan coping strategies, and once we‚Äôre in a better place, finally reassess our basic values & attitudes of human worth for the prevention of depressive episodes. 


I‚Äôm still really green to understanding therapy(as much as a self-taught person can from the condensed knowledge of experts laid out in layman terms for us) & haven‚Äôt delved to other aspects like the internal family system(IFS) but I just wanted to share with u a direction for, hopefully, feeling good for once.",10,1744313380.0,Plastic_Bus1624,SGExams

But I would like to caution other people in this thread from applying CBT frameworks to your depression without evaluating the causes of your depression. CBT can explain *some* experiences of depression. But definitely not all experiences of depression. And its way of explaining things is actively harmful to some people who may be viewed as having depression. 

What can be classified as ""chronic depression"" from a young age is more likely due to an unhealthy developmental environment and/or shit circumstances. It is much more likely when one's parents/primary caregivers are unable to foster healthy emotional development in their child, like neglecting their emotional needs, not giving them comfort or teaching them how to cope with emotions, ignoring them or being too overly involved to the point where it's overwhelming, insulting and belittling their kids, being very inconsistent and unpredictable etc. At the very least, even if parents do not add anything directly harmful, the child will turn out more emotionally vulnerable and less able to cope healthily if they do not build healthy coping mechanisms early in life. 

When a child experiences ostracization and rejection by peers (or teachers), it can very well cause them to feel like they will never be accepted, or do not even deserve to be accepted by other people. It is not something your rational faculties can control. You can rationally insist that everything they're saying about you is unfair and untrue, but when you are called an unlovable piece of shit, waste of life and resources, a joke, etc. etc. and told to get lost thousands of times on a regular basis, part of you deep down, that doesn't just intellectualize things, is going to be severely affected. Especially if you're still a child. You can't just tell a child to stop ""thinking that"" those things are true, the rational part(s) of them may not believe in those at all, and they can still be depressed overall. 

Sometimes depression can almost completely be attributed to ""shit life syndrome"", where some circumstances make life actively painful to live. Some things may inject pain into everything that used to make you happy. Unless those circumstances affect you less or stop affecting you, you're unlikely to stop being in a depressive state most of the time. When those circumstances are removed, you may suddenly be a lot better without changing your thoughts etc.",4,1744343211.0,nonintersectinglines,SGExams

you don‚Äôt have to worry about not making friends in uni, i‚Äôm pretty sure when the time comes and sch starts for u u will definitely talk to some people and they might end up as your friends, so don‚Äôt overthink about that too much! it may seem like u don‚Äôt know anybody there yet but hey we all experience this in our lives atleast once. when the time comes, you will make friends, just relax for now as you had just gotten ur results and don‚Äôt stress yourself out too much. i‚Äôm also pretty sure there are ppl that went to the same private uni as u feeling the same way rn, so u aren‚Äôt alone! all unis will also have their different uni life, and different unis offer different activities for their students to bond and make their experience unforgettable! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

i‚Äôm so very sorry to hear about your childhood and i know that you would do those things due to childhood trauma and overly rely on your friends as you did not have that stability back at home. however, as you can see your friends did not really like the way you did those actions because honestly as a person in your friends‚Äô shoes, it‚Äôs going to be very draining and demanding due to the constant bombarding of messages and calls, as well as the stress to handle those secrets you would tell them all the time. i‚Äôm not saying this is your fault, childhood trauma is the reason of your actions but it‚Äôs not the excuse to every mistake you make. if it really doesn‚Äôt get better for you, i would advice you to go to a therapist to better understand yourself, and talk things out with him/her. this would benefit you greatly, and it will also come in handy when it comes to personal relationships in the future! 

you can take this experience as a lesson, i know it‚Äôs very hard for you to not overly rely on your friends for stability but you also have to understand that people, even your closest friends, have their own boundaries. ultimately, just take you going to the private Uni as a fresh start! you can take the time before sch starts for u to reflect on what happened, and understand the fact that people have their own boundaries. i see that you already know that you overdid the texts and calls which means acknowledging your mistake ‚Äî and that‚Äôs already a massive step! i‚Äôm pretty sure you wld be able to make friends in uni, all the best to you op! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",8,1744292774.0,ilikeblindboxes,SGExams

Another thing about the direct PhD route: Our system follows the US system very closely. That is why you still see courses and the qualifying exam, as well as the ""mastering out"" option. In other systems, in which you get into a PhD by the virtue of your masters thesis, there are no courses, no qualifying exam, and the year of candiature is reduced by one year (not that many people want to finish their PhD quickly anyways as the profs pays them well).

another thing about rp is that we change classes every sem unlike other polys where they change every year. so sometimes it might be hard to maintain friendships cuz of the short period of time yall have and then get seperated into diff classes, but if u guys form a gc and and make effort to meet up once it awhile itll be fine!!!

1jwlib8,HELP ME ts pmo ong vro,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jwlib8/help_me_ts_pmo_ong_vro/,mmjbcfd,"To do well in the A levels, you genuinely don't have to aim to ""ace all subjects"". Just make sure you do *enough* things *well enough*, always focus on what gets you marks most effectively, make the most use out of every single time you study (don't study just for the sake of ""doing something productive""). 

When I did my actual A level Physics papers 2 and 3, I didn't even learn the last two out of 20 chapters (quantum and nuclear), and had to skip 30% of paper 2 because I was absolutely clueless. However, it was a strategic decision so I could put the little time I had left into making sure I can score for the chapters I already knew. Only learned quantum and nuclear before the MCQ, it was extremely easy so I regretted not learning. But it paid off in the end, I still got an A despite minimal practice and not even doing the bare minimum expected of me. 

I practically only finished learning 1/5 of the JC2 syllabus for each science subject by late May, and spent less than one and half hours touching academics outside of school lessons from then until the A levels (I tracked very diligently). Did very little practice, but tried to make the most out of every time I studied. Got 90rp in the end (this was last year). 

I'm not encouraging **anyone** to be like me if they are able to study even a little bit more. It would just stack the odds against you, but my point is that getting straight A's is still more possible than you would expect even if you feel like you're *vastly* underprepared. Work on the strategy and effectiveness in studying. Don't drop Physics just because it seems like you won't be able to be great at every subject during the A levels. One of my med interviews is tmr. I could give you a little more help after that.",1,1744364560.0,anonthrowaway729,SGExams

On the whole Id strong suggest you explore other options. Even retakers need a year of exam prep, let alone someone who has zero JC/MI experience. Plus your poly gpa doesn't give the sense that you are academically inclined and/or can lock in and grind (sorry). If you die die must do A levels, go sign up with a course provider like MDIS.

in terms of the quality of the course and where they stand, usually people will go to nus for cs, not too sure how smu and ntu compares. but i think there are other things to consider too. for eg, do you prefer large group lectures with hundreds of ppl and tutorial groups, or small class (\~45pax) seminar style lessons? do the schools have established alumni networks that students can tap on, and are there academic (or non-academic) ccas that you can joiin to further grow your skills? etcetc",1,1744363157.0,tastelikelemonade,SGExams

CS in SMU are filled with people like you, most of us are not talkers, we are all tech guys/girls after all. That being said, theres not much of hall life here being in the central of SG, but we do have a very colorful CCA scene which imo makes it up alot. I have had my fair share of friends and fun with my CCAs and events. I have also heard that NTU profs are great at doing research but cant teach. In SMU of course there are some profs that aren't too great as well but some are honestly solid to the point where we want to maintain a connection with them. 

This brings me to my personal take, I understand you are an introvert but I recommend putting yourself in an environment to help you speak out more and be comfortable with socialising because out in the industry, network is everything and uni is about the best place you can do it. When we do out to work anyways you will realise you do nothing alone, everything is in teams and you HAVE to talk to almost everyone as there are many stakeholders in every project.

SMU and NTU Biz/Acct DDP's are known to not be very heavy, as the overlap between Biz and Acct is very high for both. Probably about 3-5 more courses and you will be able to grad in 4 years (with careful planning and overloading i have heard some in Biz/Acc DDP do it in 3.5 even). NUS in fact dosent have such a DDP, the equivalent in NUS is a BBA with Acct major with a 2nd major in another business field. 

DDP generally can open a few more doors to you, but you have to do your planning correctly. Whether you want SMU or NTU is dependent on where you stay and whether you want to stay in hall- if you want hall activities and dont mind the commute/stay in west side, go NTU, otherwise go SMU.",1,1744354223.0,joeltan111,SGExams

I‚Äôve worked and interned at US/UK/EU MNCs in Singapore, and during recruitment, there‚Äôs no differentiation between the big three universities‚Äî all three are seen as target universities (I work in HR).

And to give a bit of context, big MNCs usually have a list of target universities that‚Äôs shared across countries. This helps inform senior management on how they‚Äôll recruit students and which universities they‚Äôll be hiring from. So even if OP wants to work overseas at a big MNC, it doesn‚Äôt really matter at the end of the day‚Äî all three unis are considered target schools.

My wife and I prepped our son and interviewed him ourselves as preparation. Virtually nothing we discussed came up. Nothing about him or why he wants the scholarship. Nothing about his schooling, VIA or leadership. It was a very general conversation about the subject he‚Äôs interested in. It didn‚Äôt go great; nor was it terrible. He was given the scholarship the same day.

In short, it is very subjective. It depends on the interviewer. Just prepare for anything.

I note with interest that not a single redditor acknowledges the importance of the referee report. I personally think it is the most important part of the application. Everyone knows that VIA is insincere B.S. (for the most part). If it was me (and assuming you have 3 H2 As and at least a B for GP,   I‚Äôd look at what your teacher(s) say about you.

There were 3 professors during my interview: 1 teaching Physics, 1 teaching Life Science and 1 teaching Data Science/Statistics. They asked me a mix of personal and knowledge-based questions.

Only the professor teaching Data Science/Statistics asked me a series of ‚Äòknowledge-based technical‚Äô questions relating to my chosen field of study, but nothing too in-depth like asking me to code.

Some of the questions were:

- What‚Äôs the use of ‚ÄòXXX‚Äô statistical test in research, and do you know who invented it? What‚Äôs the difference between ‚ÄòXXX‚Äô and ‚ÄòYYY‚Äô test?
- How would having a strong foundation in mathematics be useful in ML and AI?

\- Discounts/Vouchers for couples (giving birth, childcare, baby necessities) - easiest to implement but might have least effect if the vouchers are miniscule 

\- Workplace overhauls (more maternity leaves) - effective for women who wants to give birth, cos a lot of work place expects them to still go to work even deep into pregnancy

\- Cultural overhaul (similar to previous one, but more on the colleague//employer's treatment of the pregnant lady, cos there are instances where there is pregnancy-discrimination, as weird as it sounds)

Most likely to graduate with a cgpa around high 3.9x and I'm also looking to take private a levels for math only to meet the prerequisite for some courses. I'm aware of the many bonded scholarships which can support overseas unis but are there any bond free ones? Also applicable for poly grads to apply for.

# For Singapore Sustainability Scholarship, try to focus on long-term impact, environmental policy, or green innovation. If you‚Äôve done anything related to climate, sustainability, or resource management, mention it. Keep it relevant.

biggest tip for gpa is to just stay on top of everything. some things are out of your control like group mates, but if you try your best and aim for 80‚Äì100% for every small component, your overall will still remain stable.

also, try not to mix with the wrong crowds as they can really shape your mindset, and that affects your results and the effort you put into projects, exams, etc. my first year (which was also my best academic year), i was quite introverted and mostly kept to myself, the kind to go to the library before and after class lol. but over time, i learnt how to balance social life and studies better in the later years, and i don‚Äôt regret it at all as it made my overall experience better.

since our school is in the CBD area, it makes it flexible for travelling around (e.g. when you do part-time internship)/come for classes.

Biz/Finance and Econ share very similar job prospects, outside of academia or specific industries like EDB or MTI.

Yet, you can ask around and generally people find business easier because you aren't doing heavy math for 60-70% of your university modules, there's more leeway with projects, essays, reports than exams which are bread and butter for SMU Econs at least.

Unless someone is particularly interested in niche econ industries/academia or is a masochist for mathematics in Calculus and Statistical fields, Econ will be living your Uni life on hard mode for no extra payoff.

Pick biz instead unless you're sure you enjoy the math used in economics, you'll find it easier to hold a higher GPA. Don't believe me? Just compare SMU Dean's List for SOE vs SOB, the proportion of DL's to the cohort is very different.

All for the message you're putting out there about not putting the prestigious courses on a pedestral.
However, this statement on 'not doing the conventional wowwww roles' and implying that these medical graduates are somehow doing less than expected is quite ignorant. Primary care doctors (GPs, hospitalists) are essential to sg especially with the aging population. Reality is, most patients are going to see a primary care doctor first, and most will be cured at that stage and never need to see a specialist. Primary care doctors absolutely save lives. They are just as qualified and important as surgeons who happened to choose the more glorified path.
Totally support not viewing ppl in prestigious undergrad courses as gods or anything, and I agree that the selection process is very luck-based. However, within medicine, looking down on GPs is not the way to go. üôÉ",61,1744251231.0,fructose_juxtapose,SGExams

yes coming from a layman‚Äôs perspective i 100% respect the role of general practitioners in the medical community in Singapore. they are paramount to the health landscape here and as a patient i would never look down on GPs. infact if i‚Äôm not mistaken GPs are specialists in family medicine too! however i‚Äôm not sure how exactly family medicine doctors differ from non-specialists so i wld appreciate if anyone can enlighten me :-)

however my perspective stems mainly from the hierarchy within medical students themselves. i‚Äôm still in undergrad so i don‚Äôt have connections with practicing doctors but all i can say is for my friends in med both locally and overseas, it is definitely an observable trend that most of them don‚Äôt buy into the idea of becoming a generalist themselves. 

in fact in med school it‚Äôs quite common for m1 and m2s alike to say ‚Äòno way i studied so much just to give people Panadol lol!‚Äô it‚Äôs a half joke so there‚Äôs some validity in saying the life of a generalist is not what plenty of med students really want in the future.

For UK, both UCL and Edinburgh are considered top UK schools in eyes of academia circle, though UCL has an overall better reputation. But these two are still behind the top tier like Oxbridge/ICL/Warwick, so I'd put Edinburgh and UCL on same league for math. UCL is way harder than get scholarship and more expensive compared to Edinburgh (I did that before so I know).

If u really want to leave SG for broader overseas career networking, have a head start in UK academia circle and can spend some money after applying for partial scholarship, then Edinburgh is the choice imo. Another thing is for UK curriculum, it's 3-year compared to 4-year for bachelor. Since you are thinking of entering academia, taking the UK education route may be faster, since a UK Masters is taken at 4th year that usually qualifies for direct entry into PhD (for competitive UK PhD program, u need to have minimum second upper bachelor+distinction for Masters).",1,1744312780.0,observer2025,SGExams

I graduated 20 years ago. And while I was prepared for the finals, I also recognized that I could have been cruelly and utterly exposed in many ways.  

I graduated almost close to mid of the pack (by some way, the actual numerical ranking was leaked in our year). B for surgery. B for medicine. 
I was below average for the written paper I'm sure.

Everyone (at least for the average Joes and Janes, not the Dean listers) know it's possible to screw it up.

MBBS clinicals has a certain amount of luck to it. I got the top 2 most feared examiner for my mbbs medical shorts (she didn't suffer fools at all...). 

I did well on 1st case, failed the 2nd case. Thought I may die liao while walking to the bed of the last case. If the 3rd case wasn't good, G G. 
Lucky slam dunked the last one and even got a smile out of her cos I just regurgitated everything out ad verbatim from talley o Connor and baliga. 
Hey that's luck. If the 3rd case was difficult, I would have failed. 

One of my buddies who is now a deputy hod in one of the RH A&E failed his mbbs too and became our friend through MOCC (he's senior by one year). I feel safe knowing he's helming one of the busiest a&e in sg.

Firstly, like what everyone said here, I know of MANY doctors who have failed final MBBS but went on to achieve great things (e.g. Ophthalmologist, General surgeons, ENT, Urologist, Geriatrician, big shot GPs with multiple clinics, etc.) and some even went on to hold key leadership positions.

Secondly, it may feel like it's the end of the world. But this feeling will pass and you will move on with your life. It's gonna be all ok.

Thirdly, while some examiners are more strict than others, the system is designed to moderate for this and to try its best to pass you barring some catastrophy. We don't have the details on why you failed but it's fully necessary to properly reflect on what and why you didn't pass. In most cases, we try to pass you by default. The reason why you think you failed may not be the real reason you failed so some deeper analysis may be required.

You might not fall in this category but based on my anecdotal analysis most people that fail aren't able to self reflect and recognise their shortcomings. They tend to blame everything else and deflect from their own deficiencies because it makes them feel better.

Life has to go on. Take some time to grieve the pull yourself up by your bootstraps and carry on.

i remember like it was yesterday... the feeling of having a pit in my stomach and being shocked and overwhelmed

and it was likely due to badly failing my long case due to a mixture of nerves, and being unfortunate enough to kena the Paeds instead of adult medicine station, with an infamous strict and scary examiner

the seniors in charge of post-failing debrief were very nice and they did rightly point out like many of these other comments, that many other now-highly-regarded doctors had previously failed MBBS too. iirc this included Paul Tambyah, who is now president of international ID!

use the next few months to reflect and also revise for your supps. not just clinical skills, but soft skills like empathy, and strategies to hit the important criteria for each station. 

the tutors chosen to help you for supps are the best of the best, and approachable and nice. so take full advantage of this

i managed to get an A for supps in the end. i should warn you to be mentally prepared that while some stations in supps are paradoxically harder than the initial MBBS, don't be disheartened. no one in my supps batch failed supps

i would also like to point out that in some ways, this can be beneficial. you get more time before you start working, to work on your fundamentals. also, being out of phase could potentially be advantageous in securing competitive HOPEX or interim MOPEX postings

looking back, i also realise that even though i failed MBBS and most of my peers passed, but at the end of HO year, i passed without issues and some of my peers failed HO year

and in fact HO year is more important than MBBS. failing it means a delay in getting your full registration, which has much more important implications on your career prospects, be it residency or breaking bond/leaving to become GP

i got into residency and no one ever asked me about failing MBBS either

There is also something that you are going to gain that your friends aren‚Äôt, and it is *this* experience itself. The value of it cannot be overstated because you are going on a path that at first seems cruel, but is also going to let you have a perspective that others don‚Äôt have, like empathy, sensitivity, persistence etc. And you will probably have a realistic view of what real life is like because sometimes you just don‚Äôt have an answer. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that yes, you will graduate later than your classmates. But on the whole, you will probably learn a lot more than if you passed the first time. There is a real advantage in this actually. Keep at it! And is it possible to ask for actual feedback on the reasons for the markdown?

try to go in depth in the topic and the second there is something you don't quite get, find out using online resources like YouTube or chatgpt. don't be afraid to be curious, because the more you understand the better you'll be at the topic.
just make sure what you see online is accurate though, and ask for simplified versions from chatgpt if you don't quite get it.

Totally understand your situation and understand your concerns but just wanna offer a different perspective cause it seems as though you're leaning towards a black-or-white choice.

Why not consider doing something else related to medicine locally first? Having more work/life experience first before stepping into medicine will never be considered something bad because you'd be able to gain more experience before stepping into a 5 whole year commitment. (Experience in the medical world is something that is highly regarded, so it's plus points for you)

Nursing would be a good choice if you are looking at still having a social life while spending time with your loved ones. (Bonus because u get to learn how to take care of the elderly too!) 

Though on the downside it would mean ""delaying"" your time by going through with this path, it just seems like a better option to go through with what you want in both ur career and personal life.

to answer, the course structure and content definitely centres around HR more as there are more HR modules than psychology modules. after all, it is a WITH psychology course, so the psychology component is more of a side thing. i do definitely look forward to and enjoy the psychology modules more! content itself and lectures can be pretty interesting. but keep in mind that the psychology modules will also be somehow still linked to HR in a sense that you will need to apply the concepts learned into HR-related situations, especially assignment-wise. the examples used and questions asked, they structure them in HR context. for instance, modules like psychology in counselling, psychology in work behaviour, and negotiation and conflict management. 

both the psychology and hr modules will only be touched on from year 2 onwards, year 1 will focus on common biz modules like accountancy, economics, etc.

so i‚Äôd say despite the incorporation of psychology modules, the whole course ultimately focuses on the HR aspect. some of the HR modules such as performance management and total rewards management on the other hand are very heavy on theory however, so they do require quite a bit of memorisation. some of the modules like talent acquisition consist of both practical application and theory content in their assignments! in one of the assignments for example, you will be graded on how you conduct interviews. 

overall, the lecturers are really friendly! biggest tip is to not be afraid to speak out when in doubt becos trust, the lecturers would be more than happy to help you out. as any other course, it‚Äôll be better to clarify your doubts as soon as possible rather than letting them snowball. 

overall, i really enjoyed my 3 years, feel free to PM/reply if you have anymore questions :) all the best and hope you have fun!!",1,1744302151.0,ehyamete,SGExams

\- Go for some competition where you can get medals, and use those accomplishments to push your way in

\- Take up some official certifications where it upskills you and hopefully pushes you into the consideration

\- Get a full time job (this is where your grades will also help), work for a bit in the industry, then apply for NTU after you've had good experience and performance, and use your industrial experience to push you in

\- Part time uni (not smth i would choose, but can be considered)

It was not like that except in my Y3-Y4 class regarding the grades (not the money), because there was a big group of people who had kiasu China parents and did a bunch of Olympiads. Many of them also went to the exclusive classes that were training beyond the syllabus for one or more subjects in JC (Raffles Academy). I was also an Olympiad-doer in secondary school but the Y3-Y4 class sucked so bad that when I went to JC, I didn't apply for anything of that sort, chilled tf out, and took a rare science combination with Lit (100% no regret). Class had a more diverse background and was never like that again. 

Different neighborhood schools are also built very differently. When I was in a *bad* neighborhood school in lower primary, the kids weren't sensitive at all, but I'm not sure if it ever got better when they grew older. Many of the boys thought they were very cool, went around physically punching, slapping, and kicking girls during recess (without causing visible injuries), made them cry, and nothing was done about it. When I fought back and got someone to admit defeat (also without causing injuries), the teachers would say both of us were equally in the wrong regardless of who started the fight first. One of these boys got sent to the principal's office once, but only for causing disruption in class, became completely tame for a few weeks, then completely went back to his old ways. There was also a bunch of students who consistently got 0 or 1 out of 10 for English spelling but liked randomly calling me (among others) an idiot. (My English was very bad but I could still consistently get about 7/10 or above.) Then I went to a better neighborhood school, where it was a lot more chill.",16,1744196494.0,synthia262,SGExams

When I was in secondary school, they really didn't see you as rich or poor - everyone was judged by their academic and CCA performance. Naturally, those born into wealth will have access to resources, meaning they could get good tutors, good food, etc that helps them reach and sustain performance in school.

I wasn't nearly as rich as some of them - I only lived in a semi-detached in Serangoon Gardens last time. Some of my classmates lived in Bukit Timah landed property. Still, we all mixed well together. I had a schoolmate who was really poor and lived in a 3-room HDB flat but he's a doctor now.

if you feel like you're missing out on acads, you can find friends who can push you to greater heights and help you on your way to the top! now that i got into a JC a tier better than my secondary school (which relatives and strangers claim to be elite and famous), i can more easily find friends who are willing to help others and have better resources to do so. you can start friendly academic competitions with them too if you're the competitive type!

it's normal to have many wealthy students in better tier schools. it's common to see students living in landed and condos here and just like you i do feel envious. i'm one of the minority who takes public transport to school and whenever i walk past the front gate i will see a slew of expensive cars; ferrari, bmw, mercedes ‚Äì just to name a few. plus, most of my schoolmates take on 2-3 ccas on top of their self-initiated projects and external responsibilities like work attachments that they obtained through connections (eg parents are lawyers/doctors), yet they finish homeworks way faster and better in quality than me. i feel so inferior. despite being behind and less privileged, they did not discriminate me and still treated me very well. they are always open to teaching me difficult concepts and giving encouragements üî•

And always ask yourself what if I lose this , what if I don‚Äôt have this ? What would I do ? It‚Äôs the best attitude to lead your life as it‚Äôs a constant reminder of the impermanence of all these things ? 


Otherwise why do you think there are notable filthy rich people who committed sucide after they lost literally everything in their life , because their happiness and even will to live is rooted in things , things that will die , things that will rot, things that will disappear. 



And never fear death , just as we love to live and love life as much so should we love death and no matter how painful our death if we are to suffer a painful death , let us now die in peace , knowing that we lived a life we do not regret and have fulfilled our duties/ responsibilities",0,1744196682.0,Helpful-Apricot1326,SGExams

I kept pressuring myself that I have to go to JC no matter what if not it was the end of the world. Ifl bc of that I crashed and burnt and I wasn't even part of the 46% who could go to JC so you could imagine how lost I felt bc poly wasn't in the cards for me atp. I ended up going to MI bc at least I could take A levels and get the 'JC experience' just that it would be 3 years instead of 2. But even if you don't get to take A levels, it really isn't the end all be all. A lot of people end up getting extremely burnt out and don't do well for As, and we all know an A level cert won't do you any good besides giving you a one-way ticket to uni (and only provided you meet the IGPs)... so I would say don't put too much pressure on yourself, bc you alw have options that will lead you to your end destination (which I'm assuming is uni since you wanna go to JC). Brand name rly doesn't matter as long as you make it at the end of the day, take it from someone who went to a shitty neighbourhood sec sch, to MI, to NUS biz.

I went to one of the sec schools with the absolute lowest psle scores for express and thereafter managed to work my way into the top class (the only pure sci class)

Sure, not many in my school went to jc, but for the third of my class that did, they ended up with damn good scores (majority mid 80rp to near 90rp with h3). In the same vein, we all were from differing jcs, and even most of those from the 'lower-tier' jcs had those scores.

If anything, it is your mindset that determines how far you go, the ones that didnt do well in either o or a levels in my class had a poor attitude; To elaborate, your mindset can also occur in jc, which makes this notion, if anything, a self-fulfilling prophecy. One of my classmates went to the same lower-tier jc as me and just completely gave up, ended up spending 2 years just to have fun and ended up with bad a level grades.

With that said, have a goal that is realistic (i wasnt aiming for higher-tier jcs after having deliberated the pros and cons for each), and i knew my mindset wouldnt be tarnished by being in a lower-tier jc, so i just worked towards that in sec school. I got in the jc i wanted and viola, despite being in a lower-tier jc, my results are much higher than i was aiming for, and i can go to all the courses i want to go in the uni i want to go.",16,1744193350.0,IslandDestroyers,SGExams

I was a mixed grades of C6,C5 and B4s (Occasionally D7 for math) until my sec 4 year June. I barely got into my secondary school Express stream too. And that was already a way later start than people who always been scoring As. But I graduated one of the highest scorer for O levels with a single digit.

Honestly it may not seem it now, but O levels can be achievable and it's not too late for you now. If your school is bad, I would advise finding just that one or two few teachers that are willing to listen to you or teach you. If you have any questions ask them, go find them after class, ask if they have time.
From what I can see, you're a triple science student and you already seem way brighter than me at that time.

I managed to get a single digit because during that final year, I just kept doing and doing and doing past year papers non stop and asking teachers about the things I don't know, and kept redoing the questions and similar questions until it finally worked.

And for reference, mine was a neighbourhood school too. My secondary school was christ church secondary school.

In terms of school fees, since SIT is only about 1 year, the uni fees will be lower compared to NUS. So if you are worried about this, go SIT.

Also, since you graduate earlier, you can work on your career earlier so that's annother plus point.

However, since NUS is 3 years + 1 years (if hons), you will have 4 years of uni life, where you can temporarily escape from adult responsibilities for a while.

He probably wouldn‚Äôt feel like he would be better off if he were more like the average person.

My peers were mostly bright, kind, and supportive and surprisingly understandable of my emotional outbursts.

I have shitty genetics in many aspects, so I'm just thankful I was blessed with high intelligence. I was raised in a broken home rife with financial distress and suffered many traumatic events in my childhood, but GEP helped to uplift me in many ways, the most important being the impact on socioeconomic success.

Later in life when I eventually broke down and went into a spiral of depression, the ""pedigree"" of top schools made it very easy for me to bounce back. I was given second chances by the system and society in general, and was able to enter university and get a decent job with minimal effort. My brilliance meant I never had to struggle with exam stress and top grades came easily, although a minor side effect is that I'm sorely lacking in work ethic and discipline.

As for relating to people - no, I've never been able to relate to people. Partially because I'm on the spectrum, but mostly due to the gulf in intellect. I feel great empathy for those who suffer, but I can't relate to most people in most other ways. I can understand their biases and irrationality, but I can't relate. I've never felt the allure of branded goods or celebrities or trends a single time in my life, for one. It's incredibly lonely at the top, and it makes dating nightmarish if one's stubborn about intellectual compatibility. But as mentioned earlier, these are minor inconveniences in the grand scheme of things.

Had I been born with average intelligence, my quality of life would absolutely be in the gutters given the bottom-quartile starting hand I was dealt.

The practical essence of GEP is to develop students' intellectual abilities *at the expense of other areas*. Students are placed in an environment where they focus on accelerated learning, but it's also where they are constantly being reinforced with the idea that they are special, and where their social awkwardness gets validated rather than addressed.

This kind of unbalanced development pays off very little in the long run. Most eventually come down from the ivory tower by the end of secondary school, either because they no longer find themselves particularly exceptional or because they start having other desires in life. They struggle when this happens due to their weaker soft skills ‚Äî my observation is that, at the end of JC, people who were not in GEP but nevertheless did very well academically are on average in a far better position to succeed in conventional life.

The point I hope to bring across is that most gifted students *are* average persons; the primary problem is with gifted education rather than being gifted. Many gifted students continue to support gifted programmes, but it is my opinion that they are largely just blinded by the comfort and ease that the environment provides and fail to recognise that a mainstream education would really have suited them better.",1,1744339269.0,PrestigiousMission96,SGExams

If humans become obsolete for labor or thinking, is that the end of our species? (not that I mind)

If humans outsource our thinking and labor to AI /automation, then what will the average human do? Our value which has been tied to labor and productivity for millenia are now outclassed by something we built. And that it can continue improving itself without further human intervention (seemingly)

So then what becomes of human life? How will the average non-AI owner ever compete against the output of a superadvanced AI? Are we all just no longer deserving of life then? Because we cannot provide efficient value?

Progress for AI/automation is great, but profits still have to come from humans because machines are not societies that have wants or desires.

But when humans have no way of getting income, who will the AI-owners earn profit from?

That leads to loss of jobs, and then as AI advancement progresses, eventually most humans would be out of jobs. 

We're already slowly moving towards AI for decision making. Ultimately the decision itself cannot be done solely by the AI because an AI cannot be responsible, but we all know decision making is not a job that everyone can do (in terms of volume. There's just not that many decisions to be made all the time)

In the end are all humans just meant to be manager of AI drones? How many managers do you realistically need when all the AI are basically flawless and needs no rest? Shift work for managing AIs?

The only thing humans will have above AI in the future will be our sense of responsibility. How do you tie that into profit?

Capitalism will need to evolve, but the top dogs of capitalism won't want it to. They'll own the AIs and they'll make us pay even though most of us will no longer have money to pay due to losing jobs to AI.

but overall can use telegram channels to read titles. If you‚Äôre from njc then can use their news website also bcs it‚Äôs organised + curated and can be searched by topic and tys question 

i found out about what in the world and the documentary actl after my alvls but realised how useful they were

talking points can watch while eating bcs it‚Äôs not so boring

I do not know what message you speak of, but generally o level english ( expository iirc ) and a level gp WANTS students to think and gain information out of singapore. Sure, you can include examples in SG, but to only use it is crude and will likely backfire on you if they didn‚Äôt restrict the question to singapore context.

for combi sci, it seems that the general requirement is that u get A2 to be able to take 1 H2 sci. if u plan to take 2 H2 sci, some schools require u to get A1 combi sci or take at least 1 pure sci for 2 H2 (i think YIJC is like that?). not sure if this restriction on 2 H2 sxi for combi sci still holds if ur 2nd H2 sci is computing tho

(1) If you actually know a thing or two about high finance hiring, there‚Äôs a term called ‚Äútarget schools‚Äù. Unfortunately, due to the competitive nature of high finance roles, it is normally easier to be shortlisted if you come from a target schools. Even so, I can safely say both NUS and SMU are seen equally at least in local high finance employers eyes. In fact, employers don‚Äôt give two shits about local unis, Oxbridge and Ivies is what stands out for them. 

(2) what? I honestly don‚Äôt know what is the point of your comment? So students should go to universities that can best provide them an illusion of success? If that‚Äôs the case, I would rather go NUS then. I enter university to have a realistic prospect of my future, not be sold a dream that can‚Äôt be materialised. Once again I have no idea where you‚Äôre trying to go with this statement.


(3) You are the one that brought up high finance, not me. No idea why you‚Äôre calling me narrow minded for only thinking about high finance when you‚Äôre the one that mentioned it first? I‚Äôm so confused. 

It might not mean much to you, but advice that you dump carelessly on threads like this actually influences a person‚Äôs decision. Don‚Äôt go spreading ‚Äúfacts‚Äù you can‚Äôt even justify.

What are you missing out in tutorials? The questions you have posted indicate possibly -- I don't know which of the following, but see which one applies to you:

1. Did the subject tutors go through rubrics for essays in class?
2. Or you don't understand the rubrics. (Note: I don't mean to accuse you. I just want you to diagnose how your learning gaps occurred.)

\[for gp, is it just about memorizing examples from various topics? how to score well for an essay?\] -> Much more than just memorization because the essay rubrics already state that to achieve highest levels/marks you need to show the marker you are able to define the scope of the question, show understanding of what essay keywords require of you. PLEASE always have a copy of the official SEAB rubrics. Read carefully what problems put an essay into the bottom bands, AND what the different between the A-band descriptor and B-band descriptor is.

By understanding each essay question comprehensively, you can then plan and apply arguments and counterarguments. Examples and case studies are to support arguments, counter-arguments and refutations. EVEN IF you go memorize, ahem cough cough, model essays, if you don't understand the thinking process of the essay writer, and you don't strengthen your own thinking process, you won't attain develop your ability to reach higher levels/marks.

I don;t have the experience with Physics and Geog, but again you want to go beyond the usual ""study content"". It's you figuring out what concepts in the topics you are unsure about and developing a good rapport with your teachers by being motivated enough to consult them REGULARLY so that teachers know you want to do well and don't want fall behind.

JC learning curve is damn steep and my biggest regret was not being consistent and being unwilling to swallow my immature pride to seek consultations with my teachers.",1,1744205984.0,aibubeizhufu93535255,SGExams
1jv56hn,questions from a j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jv56hn/questions_from_a_j1/,mm7wz9j,"for econs, memorising content alone wldnt get u far enough for an A, maybe a B if ure lucky. if u don't understand the content, it'll be hard for u to even apply the content in the first place, even if u can do qn analysis well enough. in terms of formats, there are pretty fixed formats, using thesis ant-thesis synthesis, but do be discerning as some qns may not follow this format. 

for econs in general, u have to understand concepts, which graphs to use, economic terms and explanations. that said, even if u understood the content but u cant rmb it, it isn't any btr either. for essays, its impt to know which concept, which points to use, then with what u've memorised, write it down in economic terms as fast as u can - because essays are basically a time crunch, BUT always plan out ur essay points so u don't get confused halfway and waste time. for csq, if u've purely memorised content w/o understanding, it'll be pretty hard for u to identify the concepts in the case study and atq. basically, don't js memorise the content, u must understand it as well, and always answer qns in economic terms with rigour, and rmb to draw graphs whenever possible (esp for essays. for csqs, look at the mark allocation bfr deciding to draw a graph)

for essays, u'll have to be very familiar with the topics and concepts. when u've done enough practices (by j2, don't worry abt it too much now), the content and points shld come to u naturally, and it'll be more of practising writing under timed conditions rather than coming up with the points themselves. imo, its alot easier to score for essays because u have the freedom to choose ur qns, and there are qn types that u can practice for, although they might not alw come out. for csqs, alw rmb to refer back to qn context and give the case evidence when answering. since paper 2(essays) are weighted 60%, paper 1 40%, essays are actually a pretty impt part for econs, so u'll have to make sure that u're strong in writing essays to rly score for econs

for phys, which topics are u struggling in?",1,1744209851.0,Boring_Jellyfish_508,SGExams
1jv56hn,questions from a j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jv56hn/questions_from_a_j1/,mm87jyi,"j3 here!

gp is very structure-based imo. your school probably taught you to follow a certain structure when writing essays and AQs right? most of the time, markers are looking for clarity and structure rather than impressive content and language, although that can be a plus. my best advice for gp is to read up on news from different gp topics that you're interested in. for me, i loved writing about social issues/traditions/religion/arts, so a lot of my research was geared towards these topics. this helps cover a lot of ground as you will be sure to hit at least one topic when given a selection of qns. i recommend having at least 4 of these safety nets, just to be safe. please still read up on other topics as well, like tech and sustainability (topics that are on the rise), just not as in-depth as those topics that you're actually passionate about writing about. if you have these example banks, and follow the structure, you're gonna do decently as they don't have anything left to fault you for.

i didn't take physics, but i think you can consider going for tuition and seeing if it helps your understanding. assuming $$ is not a problem and you arent too busy with cca/syf.

wah econs. i had a really hard time w econs in the beginning because i was extremely unclear about what exactly i should be learning. firstly, dont bother making notes. its way too much information, and you can't guarantee a good score even if you can memorise all the concepts. econs is all about knowing when and what concept to apply. what i did was read multiple answer keys until i had an undestanding of common qns asked for each topic, and the standard answer for such questions. i would give an example but icl i can't remember much now. but let's say firms, its either gonna be about the characteristics, strategies or impacts of firms. and then theres only this many things in these 3 categories that they can ask about. at this stage, i think you can first focus on understanding the content being taught. why the price mechanism works the way it does, the different types of elasticities, etc. when that's solid and you can confidently explain it to urself w the graph, then move on to practicing essays. please ask your teacher for advice/help. i promise once u get the hang of it econs is gonna be fun. (got an A for both subjs in the end!)

didnt take geog so can't say much about that.

all the best in jc! pace yourself, ask when you need help, and stay calm. take wa1 as a learning experience. when the papers come back don't fixate on the marks; analyse your mistakes, see if there are any misconceptions that led to the mistakes being made and make sure when u cover the qn up and attempt it again, you get it right because you truly understand what went wrong.

take this with a grain of salt and always check w ur teachers! they are there to support you. feel free to pm if you have any further questions, i'll try my best to answer them. u got this!!!",1,1744212985.0,Wise-Aside-4764,SGExams

I don't know how your GP tutor teachers essay keywords question analysis. I mean, do they even do so? Or is it just tell you ""analyse the keywords"" without giving you a framework how to do so?

  
2) Another suggestion is learn to annotate your essays, and check with teacher on what went wrong. Maybe an argument is underdeveloped. Maybe your introduction did not fully define scope the question.",1,1744254184.0,aibubeizhufu93535255,SGExams

thats my personal opinion as someone who didn't do much in jc to build portfolio. i made it through the interview and all, but i feel that i lack experience compared to others esp professionally. but that said, focus on your studies first! if you have the capacity, then you can look into some small stuff on the side, or wait till after alevels then do some side quests then - alevels shld be your priority as a jc student!

for smu banking and fin, that's all under school of business's BBM. you can check out the previous years igp cut off for some reference (just google smu igp), but the score you see now will still be under the 90rp system... not too sure how that will translate to the 70rp system

**Portfolio Importance in SMU Admissions:**  
SMU does place a fair bit of emphasis on¬†holistic admissions, meaning they look beyond just grades (unlike NUS, which is more academic-focused). That said,¬†grades are still the most important factor‚Äîespecially for competitive courses like Banking & Finance (B&F). A strong portfolio helps if your RP is borderline or if you‚Äôre applying via ABA (Aptitude-Based Admissions), but if your grades are solid, you‚Äôre already in a good position.

Since you represented your school in a sport, that‚Äôs actually a decent start! SMU values leadership, CCA involvement, and unique experiences, so you can highlight that in your application.

1. not to sound like I‚Äôm belittling the struggles you face with the heavy workload, but it really is a feature of JC that you have to find a way to cope with üòì working hard is a must, but please remember to take mental breaks at times! I understand that feeling of always being behind/not getting concepts; it sucks and makes you not want to do anything. regarding your H2s, you can seek help from your subject tutors during lessons/consult to help clarify your doubts. if you‚Äôre not comfortable/too shy, you can also always join the sgexams telegram gc to inquire!

2. I was actually fortunate enough to not get full-blown slackers in my group (they were the kind to do work most of the time, but sometimes not with 100% effort). as I took on the role of group leader, I did get frustrated a few times bc the PW OP was drawing closer and yet some of them didn‚Äôt complete what I asked them to or did so with low effort. so basically, what I did was threatening to remove them from a shared google doc that included all the answers to potential questions we could be asked during the OP exam üò≠ needless to say, it did work (and our group even won best PW group in the cohort üíÄ). and if you‚Äôre curious, yes, we are still on good terms. you can try using this approach, or just straight up tell the teacher that your groupmates aren‚Äôt doing anything helpful. don‚Äôt be scared to do so!

3. sadly, I can‚Äôt comment much on this bc I mean, I don‚Äôt know your friend group personally and can‚Äôt gauge what they feel about you. I‚Äôd say just look deep within and ask yourself if you‚Äôre comfortable being around these people. if the answer is yes, then you can continue to stay friends. if the answer is no, then you can always try making new friends in class/CCA! I also started off my JC journey with little to no friends, but I slowly found them over the year :) it sounds like your closest friends are still your sec sch buddies, so perhaps you can also confide in them!

4. I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, OP üò≠ the best thing I can think of is for you to cry it out. whenever you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, do whatever helps you to vent your emotions. be it crying, talking to your sec sch friends, playing games or listening to music, etc. I get the feeling of having no energy to do anything and it sounds to me that you‚Äôre quite burnt out(?) perhaps when weekends roll around, you can rest your mind to better your mental health!

On a personal level, I am interested in tech and business combined together. I am also weighing my options. SMU can develop me on a personal level and help with my networking as well as more established in terms of Business. Whereas NTU is more established in terms of tech. 

My priorities are more towards FinTech in the future. I intend to branch out in that sector or possibly AI as well.

But there are some differences in the pedagogy and teachings as well between NTU, SMU and SMU which I heard from my tech friends, but these are hearsay and stereotypes which I had not personally experienced, hence I wont comment more - try to talk to some seniors!

For Business - You should know that NTU has a 'shorter' programme. I have a friend who managed to capitalise on the 3 year programme and get a good conversion, while graduating a year earlier despite being the same batch. However, I also know many in NTU who lament the shorter runway. 

DDP - Personally, i know very few who maintain a DDP, especially in CS and Biz, which I never heard of people maintaining this DDP before - there will be many more modules to take which most do not find worthwhile, as this time can be spent in internships or other experiences. 

FinTech - I dont know much about this... perhaps try to Linkedin undergraduates (and recent grads) who are doing well in FinTech, and understand their background - what schools they are from, what they study, and what experiences they start with. You can also cold message them to get their advice, it will be the most valuable. Students are generally willing and open to share.

Opinions on syllabus, culture, and education are plenty among this thread, the respective uni threads, and online websites. Location etc., is important and dont undervalue this factor - maybe you like the hall life in NTU, or maybe SMU's location and class timings can be beneficial for part-time internships near town or night classes while having FT internships.",1,1744219342.0,charizardroar,SGExams

It brings no benefits to the university at all to delay a student's graduation or prevent them from graduating as it not only looks bad for their reputation, but also forces them to invest more resources into the ""retaining"" students, spreading out their resources thin. I'm highly doubtful they intentionally made the tests harder than they need to be, they are simply ensuring the students who graduate have a certain calibre they deem fit to award their stamp of approval - their degree.

You must have heard of the expression ‚Äòfailed state‚Äô. What‚Äôs life like for people living in a failed state? Do any failed states exist in this region?

Early Marxists assumed that the transition from capitalism to communism was inevitable - through violence. It was expected the whole of Europe would go through that transition. Why didn‚Äôt that happen? Ans: social democratic political parties raised standards for all.

LKY was always big on these issues - i.e. Singapore is one generation away from falling apart.

I took h2 lit last year so my experience is with the old syllabus but I would say that scoring C/Ds now was quite the norm for my batch a year ago and we all turned out alright at the end! But most importantly do reach out to your teachers to get more detailed feedback and work on them with every essay that you'll write in the coming months - jc lit is very different from sec sch lit from what i've heard (I went through ip tho :"")) 

I did have a similar problem with close reading and analysis initially, so something I did was to read model essays to see how other students structured their arguments and to reflect on my own work! sometimes for set texts you can also kind of memorise some common arguments with certain parts of the texts (but this is more of a cheat code haha) 

also on how to find poems to practice, I just dug up holy grail's gdrive folder for any poems and practiced with anything and everything I could find! for my school, we eventually had a booklet of poems too so I would try to work on them before class and re-did them under timed pressure as well. Something else I did was also to reach out to my friends in other schools to share resources (ie each others' papers) and discuss them! 

sorry for the long reply but jiayou op! :"") lit is a subject that is hard to improve in, but it does take a lot of consistent effort to make sense of what exam techniques work, and feel free to dm me too!",2,1744206974.0,rarararacoom,SGExams

Find poems -- I'd think finding poetry anthologies is the easy part. The difficulty is SEEING the poem from the EXAMINER's point of view.

I understand that being a nurse is one of the most mentally and physically exhausting profession anyone can partake. I know this because my gf is also a SN too and it aches my heart listening to the hardships she has to undergo (abuse from patients, witnessing deaths, overworking etc). Seeing that you are promoting to a SSN, I hope you might help me with this :(

For the past few months, my gf‚Äôs work performance has been deteriorating quite abit. Her managers and seniors are starting to berate her, which has been taking a toll on her mental wellbeing. Here are some context:

- She has a 2year contract as a SN in TTSH (General Ops) after completing her nursing degree

- Her contract ends in 2 months time

- Her work mishaps consist of: unable to complete tasks on time due to prioritisation errors, forgetting to check parameters properly due to the fast pace environment 

- She has some commitments outside of work which I advise her to drop at least one or two, such that she can focus more on her job


She is gradually getting depressed due to this and as a bf who works in a totally different industry, it is hard for me to provide the necessary support for her. I could only advise her to endure the last two months of contract work, and then do part-time nursing while hunting for another job/department.

I would like to ask if those people who were bonded vs freshly unbonded grads pay will be the same or will the fresh grads pay be higher? 
3. also when I go for my clinicals (usuallyget posted to low class wards which is 10/6 bedder), I observed tat there is litteraly 1/2 or no Singaporean nurses at all... I'm curious why is tat so? is it coz they usually assign the Singaporean nurses to be at higher class wards?

Nurses also definitely spend more time at the bedside with their patients and get to see most of the recovery process, hence my final decision to choose nursing :)

We do shift work and it‚Äôs usually 5 working days + 2 off days a week. But if you‚Äôre on night shift, your post night day is considered as your off day too which essentially leaves you with 1 off day a week Lol (we‚Äôre literally still in the ward on the morning of our ‚Äúoff day‚Äù since it‚Äôs a night shift, I honestly have 0 idea why this is counted as an off day) 

To add on, sometimes we don‚Äôt even end on time and have to stay back for 1-2h to finish up. (no such thing as OT pay/allowance in nursing btw) Even worse when it‚Äôs a PM > AM shift the next day. Only sleep at home for 5-6h then have to go back to work alr üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è Most of the times when I get to go out with friends are after my AM shifts because I won‚Äôt even have the energy to head out again after going home. On my off days I just sleep in until late afternoon and head out if I do have plans (but that‚Äôs basically half a day gone alr), otherwise I just stay home all day 

2. I‚Äôd say the pay is sufficient for me, I still have quite a good amount leftover after my monthly expenses and setting aside some for savings. This leftover amount is for me to spend/shop until the next payday, and whatever remaining I‚Äôll just put into my savings too hahah. 

But we could definitely be paid better for all of the things that we do out of our jobscope too (FYI nurses are also adhoc MSWs/PTOTs/technicians/IT repair people/customer service associates/cleaners Lololol and the list goes on)  

3. Favourite thing is seeing patients recover!! And also all the medical aspects of it too. It‚Äôs just so interesting to see how different diseases can affect how your patient presents with the symptoms and etc. 
Things I hate are mostly mentioned alr in points 1 and 2‚Ä¶ + sometimes we have to deal with super nasty patients/relatives who keep scolding us or super entitled ones (eg. independent patients who press the call bell just to ask us to pour water/cover blanket for them).

Ok but to answer your question, I‚Äôd say surgical specialties (gen surg which comprises of many sub-specialties like vascular etc. /orthopedics) are one of the less desired ones because of the high workload and turnover rates. Many seem to prefer medical specialties (GM which comprises cardio med, rheumatology, Renal etc/ICU/A&E)

Hmm maybe try to find out what is causing her to fall behind at work? Is it maybe things that she‚Äôs unsure of, or maybe she‚Äôs just feeling tired or burnout which in turn is causing her performance to drop? 

For me the only commitment I have outside of work is pilates/yoga hahah (a bit lame Lol). I do attend outside dance classes sometimes too, other than that I don‚Äôt actually have much going on. I just schedule these accordingly to my work roster, sometimes I‚Äôll request for a specific day if I really need it. 

If her contract ends and she doesn‚Äôt plan to renew, she could maybe try out locum nursing. I‚Äôve heard that locum is more flexible and pays better, but of course they don‚Äôt receive the same benefits that a full time staff does (allowances, medical coverage etc) 

Less stressful departments would be clinics (either hospital or polyclinic), however that‚Äôs mostly set aside for the more senior/older nurses/ nurses who have families. There are younger nurses in clinic too but very little. Clinic hours are the same as office hours. Or maybe a day surgery unit would suit her more? You could ask her to discuss with her managers to see how they could help her :) I know it is scary to come face to face with the managers because I‚Äôve been there too, but she has to voice out at least so they‚Äôll know that she‚Äôs feeling this way and how she‚Äôs being affected at work.

Yes you can request! ED and ICU/HD are popular choices in my hospital for NUS grads. No need prior experience for these areas but you should be prepared to face critically ill patients that can deteriorate and collapse within seconds. You need to be able to react and respond fast. 

OT is definitely more chill but also has its stressful parts. I don‚Äôt really have much friends doing OT so I can‚Äôt give any advice about how it‚Äôs like hahah

IVC insertion is only taught when you formally join as a SN. Chances of failing it are actually pretty low but I have seen a fair share of nurses who are quite bad at it hahah (I was bad at the beginning too Lol), just requires more practice! 

Getting a hematoma from IVC is actually quite rare, I‚Äôve only seen it once in my entire nursing timeline.

- If you‚Äôre not bonded/sponsored by any hospital, you can directly approach the hospital you‚Äôre interested in and apply for it. You can specify the specialty of the ward that you wanna be in but not always guaranteed that you‚Äôll get what you want. 
Certain specialties also require prior experience in bedside nursing before you can enter. 

- Hmm for nurses that are able to diagnose patients, I think you might be referring to an APN (advanced practice nurse). They‚Äôre also SNs but are able to prescribe meds/diagnose patients. This is what I‚Äôm aiming for in the later part of my career, but you will need a Masters in nursing. 

- For the rp I‚Äôm not very sure hahah because I didn‚Äôt go to JC! But I‚Äôve seen that most people say that the interview is a compulsory part of the application

- Yes there‚Äôs definitely cute/handsome doctors hahah!

with the recent batches being more gen Z I‚Äôm quite happy because I‚Äôm also gen Z.

- Pay wise if you do a bit of googling, you can probably find the chart of SG nurses starting pay somewhere. So I‚Äôll just directly say it here. Currently fresh poly grads usually get 2.5-2.7k and fresh NUS grads get around 2.9-3k+. If you have honours/first class pay is also higher. 
If you‚Äôre a guy, then the pay will definitely start from 3k and above because completed NS.

Yes you‚Äôll start off as SN I instead of SN II (poly grads usually) 

If I‚Äôm not wrong, for NUS grads the promotion to SSN is faster. Minimum 2-3 years of working experience as an SN I. 

Not really sure about the difference between a regular degree/ honours, but pay-wise I heard that for honours/first class honours their base is a lot higher.
Also in my hospital, all NUS grads have to do the GNRP program which is basically rotating out to one of the specialised areas (A&E/operating theatre/ICU) for 3 months + community hospital setting for 1-2 weeks.

PM (afternoon) shifts are 9h. Including 1h break
Night shifts are the longest, 11.5h (almost 12h). But the break is longer too, 1.5h. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs quite busy though and most of the time we don‚Äôt get to go for breaks, especially for AM shifts. Many things happen in the morning (showering/sponging, following up on doctor‚Äôs rounds/changes/plans, dressing change, scans, blood taking) hence it‚Äôs the busiest shift. 

We usually do 2 night shifts together, so the next day (AKA the morning that we go home) is considered as our off day alr. Which I think is quite stupid because how can you consider it an off day when I‚Äôm still in the ward on the morning of my ‚Äúoff day‚Äù? ü§£

You, my friend, have not merely failed every WA1 ‚Äî you‚Äôve crafted an art form out of procrastination, a symphony of self-sabotage. In fact, you‚Äôve turned failure into a hobby, elevating it to the level of an Olympic sport where you are, without question, the reigning champion. You‚Äôve spent so much time avoiding work that I‚Äôd bet you could turn ‚Äòprocrastination‚Äô into a degree if universities offered it. I can only assume that studying for you involves staring at textbooks, hoping by sheer force of will that the knowledge will somehow osmotically infiltrate your brain while you‚Äôre posting shit on Reddit.

In the face of your impending O Levels, you are, for all intents and purposes, the academic equivalent of a potato: inert, lacking any discernible purpose, and wasting away in a state of pure mediocrity. Five months? Five months is an eternity to someone who might actually want to achieve something. For you, though, it is nothing more than a mere blip on your radar of perpetual procrastination, a date in the far-off future that exists solely to haunt your dreams as the final countdown to irrelevance begins.

I can almost hear the collective groans of your potential, each one screaming in despair as it realizes its untapped brilliance will never see the light of day. You‚Äôre standing at the precipice of your future, gazing into the abyss of missed opportunities and wasted effort, all while holding onto your impressive record of zero preparation. A mere five months, and yet, you are closer to failure than an airplane is to the ground after losing its wings.

If laziness were an art form, you'd have created the Mona Lisa of missed chances. You‚Äôve already achieved the pinnacle of underachievement. Yet, I suspect that deep down, you know this is a moment for transformation ‚Äî if only you could muster the willpower to push yourself beyond your current, self-inflicted limitations. But alas, I have no delusions: you will likely continue on this same path, an unchanging monument to the tragic underperformance of human potential.

So, as you stare at the looming prospect of your O Levels, remember this: you have, quite possibly, mastered the art of being utterly unprepared. And in five months, when you are reaping the fruits of your inaction, just know that it wasn‚Äôt a lack of time that led you to failure ‚Äî it was your impeccable dedication to nothingness. Bravo.

In all important ones (like math, sciences and humanities) I was F9/E8ing as first from the back of the grades ranking for class and level ü§£. 

Here's the thing that smacked me in the face in Sec 4 though:

So there's this kid born in the same year as me interred in the same block just a few niches away from my great grandparents at their columbarium. I read about his death in Sec 1 and recognized the name there a year or two later (that death was tragedy which I shouldn't share details of avoid doxxing, suffice to say it was bad enough to be very memorable!). It was one qingming day in Sec 4 that I was standing in front of his niche Âèëing ÂëÜ while my family was off doing other things, when I wondered if he'd ever thought about taking the O's? Would Sec 4 be as difficult for him? A drag? Or would it be an interesting challenge? What CCA might he have chosen, and would it help with his COP? etc etc. Same age as us, but here is a person who will never know. 

It was a quick flash of a thought but, 'I really should treasure my possibilities' stuck in my mind that day. It started the studying ball rolling, and I made committments (like joining after school classes and study groups üôÑ) that would *keep* it rolling even if this enthusiasm wore off.

(It still makes an appearence whenever I feel a bit wrung out by things I don't want to do that must be done xD)

Failing your WA1s comprehensively just five months before the pivotal O-Levels signifies a critical lack of engagement. Worse, you admit to complete inaction regarding study despite professing a desire to succeed.

This stark contradiction between aspiration and effort is profoundly self-defeating, especially within Singapore's competitive educational landscape where O-Levels heavily influence future pathways (JC/Polytechnic). Your current trajectory points towards severely limited opportunities and predictable academic disappointment.

Foundational weaknesses highlighted by across-the-board failures demand immediate, intensive remediation. Yet, you haven't started. This level of procrastination, given the timeframe, is staggering. Five months is critically short notice to overcome such deficits; each day wasted solidifies failure.

Consider this the necessary shock: Your approach constitutes gross academic negligence. You are actively squandering potential and courting failure through complacency. The gap between your stated goals and demonstrated commitment is unacceptable.

Immediate, drastic, and disciplined effort is imperative *now*. Change your approach fundamentally, or resign yourself to the entirely self-inflicted consequences of continued inaction.",2,1744122499.0,Ill-Conversation5198,SGExams

I was literally at the bottom of my class from Sec 1 to Sec 4 and my O level results are really bad compared to my peers, who mostly scored like 9A or 10A for their O levels - we're talking 9-10 A1 scores (I took my O levels in 1999).

So don't worry if you're not doing well in your class tests, as long as you understand the concepts and can do TYS questions properly. (TYS is still a thing, right?)

To put in a bit of context, because people are wondering why in blue hell are we taking 9-10 O level subjects - two words: elite school. The black, green and white variety. Still, being at the bottom feels like crap all the same. 

I somehow feel you are in the same situation as me. Something tells me you're actually in a pretty good school, too. You can pass, but you feel like a failure when all your peers are like superstars. Well, fast forward almost 30 years later, I still feel like crap because my batch mates are like SAF generals and potential ministers in the near future.

As someone who have walked the downtrodden path, here what's in store for you.

I am going to summarized it through my life experience so here goes:

\- Failed 'O' levels and when to ITE. Fun experience TBH coz most ppl over there only want to have fun. The least stressful time of my life.

\- Went to NS. Feel discriminated against coz leadership positions are only given to others with Diploma and above. Felt a chip on the shoulder.

\- While job searching after NS, most good job opening only hire people with at least 5 'O' level passes and above. Felt discriminated again. Chip on shoulder got heavier.

\- Decided to retake O level. Passed. When to Poly. A bit stress out coz student here are super competitive and i felt a bit embarrassed coz I'm a mature student. Chip got heavier.

\- Graduated. Enter the workforce. Met some colleagues with elitist mindset. Was discriminated against once they learned that i was an ITE grad and older. Which explained why she had a higher position even though she was younger than me. Chip on shoulder starting to be a burden now.

At the same time i was taking a Part time degree while i was working my first job.

Managed to graduate.

When i was waiting to take my degree during my graduation ceremony, all these obstacles started replaying through my mind (like Nam' flashback) which almost jerked me into tears. I was telling myself, "" Dude, how far you have come in life. I am proud of you!"", the chip on my shoulder got lighter.

Point of my story is, if you not ready to suffer for the next 5 months, be prepared to suffer for the next few years of your life and the mental trauma that comes with it.

Hope my life story manage to spur you into action.",1,1744210646.0,Abg_Flash,SGExams

1. Look for suitable studying methods online. Working hard must go hand in hand with working smart. Maybe you can try to study topics using methods you find online instead of traditional grinding. You can also try doing old test papers from the library to learn from your mistakes and get used to the exam format. 
2. Have one clear goal in mind instead of multiple. Based off what you said about your routine of studying, gyming and language learning, I think you might be 'biting off more than you can chew'. Set like simple goals, eg. Being able to do 3 pull ups on the pull up bar and celebrate each little goal. Trust me mentality is important to carry you through life. And also try not to compare with others because 'comparison is the thief of joy. Just compare with your past self and be satisfied with how you did. 
3. Try and find out as much as possible about experiences in mass media management and (maybe) try out some of their work and see if you can handle the course so the same situation doesn't repeat again.

Bro, my advice for you is to seek help from an ECG counsellor first. (DO IT THIS WEEK. MAKE THaT APPOINTMENT )Read up all the different courses and modules in your polytechnic. If you want to switch course, do remember you have 10 semesters of subsidies from the government. Now you have 8 semesters left. It is either you make the decision to switch before this sem starts or next sem. To change right, you need to talk to your diploma course chair and the course chair of the diploma you want to change to.(send an email to them, and you can find them online. ) Afterwards,  you have to do a form that requires your course chair/ care person endorsement.


By the way, if you want to switch  ,you can only change in your polytechnic. Unless you really want to switch polytechnics,  then you have to wait until 2026 to apply through DAE .

For p2 structured questions, the key for me was just to read the question very closely and identify the keywords. Which words do they want? Should I group the words as a phrase or explain the meaning of each word separately. For definition questions, what are they keywords that they usually look for? What degree should I use? (Eg Angry vs Very angry)

For p2 AQ and p1, the core idea is just to understand HOW to argue your point in a coherent manner throughout your whole essay, the keyword being ARGUE. Diplomacy is the act of telling someone to go to hell in a manner so eloquent they ask you for directions. You need to decide on a stance on the question, and come up with arguments that you can expand and elaborate on not only HOW they support your stance, but also why the situation/problem you are describing even exists in the real world in the first place. When doing your counter argument, it needs to be smartly angled in a way that makes full sense, but also has enough gaps and holes for you to exploit and attack in your rebuttal in order to maintain clarity of stance throughout your essay.

- okay yeah slapping all your 6p notes into one document and then ctrl+f and ctrl+c into the paper is one of the faster strats. i think i should also advise you to be familiar with all the topics anyways (at least enough to be able to look at the exam qn and then know how to turn the 6p notes into an exam answer) but like yeah this method is the best if you got the theory but sometimes forgor the thing.
- i‚Äôm from the games and gamification diploma so idk how much of this will apply to your msas and eses, but if you‚Äôre told in advance that you‚Äôre getting case studies to read up on for the exam? absolutely go and study the case studies and then try and write down how the concepts you learn are applied in the case study. if possible try to think of questions that might be asked in advance in reference to the case study, both so you can ctrl f ctrl c in if you get lucky, and also so you understand the case study better in general.
- extremely specific example (game theory module): week before ese we gotta play like 4 short games in advance. üò≠ aside that basically means i gotta relate a lot of topics (mda, gameplay loop, bartle player types, different types of mechanics, and more things i don‚Äôt recall off the top of my head) back to those 4 games ‚Äî i‚Äôm usually rushing pre-exam so i do really short bullet points just to cover all my bases, so that in the exam i will have something to talk about.
- i‚Äôm not gonna lie i think i‚Äôve only looked at past msa/ese papers like. once. still get at least B pretty consistently but if u really need the papers to study go for it

your first mistake is using chatgpt to mark your work etc. should only use it as a tool to enhance your writing and not as a benchmark. It can‚Äôt even get objective math questions right, much less school material. it‚Äôs very likely giving you wrong answers



what i do is i make three types of notes: 
1) a massive ahh slideshow with EVERYTHING from the modules inside
2) summaries of each lesson (as in point form)
3) reviews on answering techniques


extending on 3, usually my lecturers go through our CA/quiz answers in class. from there, you can see what they look for in your answers and reapply the same format/expectations during your ESEs. if they don‚Äôt go thru, either u analyse with classmates with better scores or you js ask your lecturer directly after class (recommended)


it‚Äôs not just about understanding the material, it‚Äôs about understanding what your lecturer wants. My first CA in a new module, i got a C+. So i shot the lect a message on how I can improve my grade, and he gave me exact suggestions. Next CA I got A


personally i don‚Äôt do the past year papers precisely because there‚Äôs no answer key. i just use them to know what kind of questions to expect. don‚Äôt need to study so hard for open book, best way to spend your time is to understand how you can answer the questions to what the lecturers want.


‚ÄúI think this is one of the disadvantages of open book exams because for close books you can just memorise that one definite answer and score the mark but for open book its so easy to go out of point‚Äù In the most polite way possible this is just plain wrong. You can still go out of point in close book. Close book is just more lenient bc open book emphasizes on application more than knowledge regurgitation.


Main point is, you need to focus on application and not just the content. and PLEASE don‚Äôt use chatgpt to check your answers/content. ask your lecturers esp since they KNOW what you need


do note i also just finished year 1 so i def have less experience but my cgpa is 3.5 currently (also a result of sem 1 slacking :( ) can def improve one atb!",1,1744171647.0,404inpain,SGExams

What, did you think in 2 mths (yes we're not that deep into the year) you'd have caught up to 2 yrs of O lvl Computing, or others who had years of self-taught exp?

For most of my students who don't have prior background, it's usually 4 mths in (around end-Apr) that they start to feel more comfortable, after we've completed Python intro (just last week), OOP, and some basic data structures. If they're hardworking and conscientious, 6 mths in (around Term 3) they'd be about on par with O lvl Computing students, if not maybe by Promos.

Learning programming is like learning a new language, it has its own rules (which are much more predictable than human languages), and you don't communicate by memorising those rules but by using the language and improving with feedback.

Your most important teacher during this learning phase is not your Computing tutor, who will only be available a few times a week, but Python, which is always available. There are a number of skills you have to work on building up, none of which are comfortable but all of which are essential. 

1. Reading code and anticipating what it will do. Again, you don't learn this by memorizing a textbook, but by writing and running enough code that you've seen most patterns before, and thinking through what happened to build your internal data model of Python.

2. Writing code, building it up from smaller pieces of code, instead of trying to write everything in linear fashion like a memorised essay. We usually write code ""inside-out"", starting what needs to happen inside a loop before we repeat the action using the loop. And then breaking down a big task into smaller tasks, and creating functions for each small task, instead of trying to whack everything in the big function.

3. Testing and catching errors, which depends on experience. You need to have made enough mistakes that when one happens in the exam, it's likely one you have made before, you are familiar with error messages and can quickly zoom in on the culprit.

4. Debugging, the logical process of making intelligent guesses about what caused an error, testing your hypothesis (to confirm your guess), and then applying the fix. You're just going to have to do lots of debugging to get better at this.",2,1744152808.0,kureshii,SGExams
