This is coming from someone who is used to cramming - js did 6 weeks of content in 2 days for a math mid term this sem. (Have done worse in past sems)

You can start by making a list of the topics that u must cover + all the algos u must know. Ideally you should start with the most important algos but i think what u really need now is motivation to let u have the inertia to continue studying. I wld advice u tackle the easier concepts first like the different types of sorting so that u can check off sth ur list 

Use visualgo to try and understand the concepts if they are available there. Else js walk thru a short YouTube video / fast forward lecture video to the portion ur prof is explaining the algo itself to understand the concept. 

Afterwards go thru PYP - prioritise those of the same format as what u will do. Is it long short answer or MCQ for ur sem? Anyway, after u have went thru the most important PYP u shld go back to the tutorial qns and make sure u understand them fully.

Cause they're not as comparable to actually taking on ML-specific mods / doing an ML-related internship and/or ML-focused research project. If you could share more about such internalized motivations, maybe there's some good reason to go for them instead. Otherwise, I don't really see the issue here.",4,1744278970.0,Keitsubori,nus

Yes to more ML mods, cause as a Y2 BZA student, by now, you should have a relatively clear idea of whether your Business Analytics and/or Business knowledge in general is grounded or lacking, and according to your post, it's the latter. 

>My motivation for pursuing a minor is to gain more knowledge outside of my field, because i think it is beneficial to have a more diverse academic knowledge, so that I can apply them in interdisciplinary settings

Ok, that's a very general reason. Can you expand on it further? As a Y2 BZA student, you would have already been exposed to the areas of Econs and Stats through your BZA CC and/or general modules. Are these modules not rigorous enough already for you? 

You also mentioned that you have tried to do some self-learning outside of school. Have you touched on Econs/Stats/QF-related materials, and how do you find them? Do you have an innate passion for these subjects, and are they stronger than your passion for ML? 

And how about your career aspirations? Have you narrowed down on top career choices, and adequately know on what knowledge/skills are required for the majority of them, thus being able to reasonably weigh between ML, Econs, Stats, and QF?

I have given explanation for each minor in my post. Like it or not, my reasons are as simple as that. One, I have genuine interest in these areas and Two, they are useful and practical in my opinion. I will not delve into the specific reasons as to why I am interested in these minors.

>As a Y2 BZA student, you would have already been exposed to the areas of Econs and Stats through your BZA CC and/or general modules. Are these modules not rigorous enough already for you?

Yes, I feel that these modules are not rigorous enough in the BZA curriculum, as they only touch on the topics briefly. That is why I am interested to learn more about them in a minor.

>Have you touched on Econs/Stats/QF-related materials, and how do you find them?

I have touched on Econs/Stats/QF-related materials on a surface level, and I find them to be practical and interesting, which is why I am finding out more about them on Reddit.

>Do you have an innate passion for these subjects, and are they stronger than your passion for ML?

I am confused by this -- Why am I supposed to choose only one of the two? Why can't I do both? I am definitely more interested in ML but can't I pursue my interest in ML while also exploring another field as a minor?

>And how about your career aspirations? Have you narrowed down on top career choices, and adequately know on what knowledge/skills are required for the majority of them, thus being able to reasonably weigh between ML, Econs, Stats, and QF?

Yes, I have noted and seen that already. I'm glad to know that you are aware that the reasons you have placed in your post are currently surface-level. There is definitely nothing wrong with that. However, you may wish to clarify and build upon these reasons with deeper research - as you may already now know by another commenter, Uni Econs is highly mathematical in nature and is nothing like JC Econs, which you seemed to be surprised about. To add on, Uni Stats does offer high application of knowledge in the real world, most notably in data modelling, computer-intensive statistical methods, and statistical learning. Uni QF is one I would be cautious of - did you even know that QF currently requires a Graduate Degree of Masters and above to be even able to enter the working field? So I will reiterate again that nothing is wrong with counting on simple personal reasons, but if you end up disliking the relevant subject minor(s) in the future and/or not finding them as ""practical and useful"" as you hoped for, you can only blame yourself for not probing and reasoning with them deeper back then. 

Of course, you probably won't care/regret as much of whatever decision you make if you are currently a scholar, or your parents fully-funded your Uni education. I'm not privileged enough to be able to forgo this thinking process, which is why I offer it to you as a potential helping tool for you. 

>One, I have genuine interest in these areas and Two, they are useful and practical in my opinion. I will not delve into the specific reasons as to why I am interested in these minors.

Ok, if you say so. I respect your genuine interest, opinion, and your personal issues. So respect mine as well as a fellow Redditor. I'm not able to stop you from making your own decisions, and they certainly hell won't affect me at all as a stranger, so why should I care in the first place, right? At minimum, you can always take my opinions with a grain of salt. 

>Yes, I feel that these modules are not rigorous enough in the BZA curriculum, as they only touch on the topics briefly. That is why I am interested to learn more about them in a minor

Ok, noted. 

>I have touched on Econs/Stats/QF-related materials on a surface level, and I find them to be practical and interesting, which is why I am finding out more about them on Reddit.

Ok, noted. But do touch your heart and tell yourself, which one did I actually like the most when reviewing their materials? And based on that, trust your own gut, not other people one's. Cause you're certainly not able to do all 3 of them minors with your current workload.

>I am confused by this -- Why am I supposed to choose only one of the two? Why can't I do both? I am definitely more interested in ML but can't I pursue my interest in ML while also exploring another field as a minor?

I don't understand your confusion. Nobody said you can't do both. I definitely didn't say that as verbatim. You're already planning to take an ML specialization, which I correctly affirmed from your post. That's already 1 of the 2 chosen, isn't it? And who are you trying to get approval from? Me? I'm neither your parent nor the NUS BZA staff who will approve your degree - I'm just a random Redditor, and you know fully well of this. The only approval you need is yourself - you clearly should know this as an adult. 

>Yes I have. ML is most important but an Econs/Stats/QF minor would be helpful too. I am here to find our more information about these areas, and not to justify my real interest to anyone questioning them.

Blah blah justify, same as getting approval, nobody's trying to woop your ass, woman. Get over it. Now if it was me, and I clearly knew that ML is THE most important for my future career aspirations, I would just focus 100% of my spare UEs into ML. Else, it would be a disservice to yourself for going against your own realized, valuable, personal thoughts.

End of the day, just be as confident in your decision as you can be, and promise yourself that you will have no regrets with it. I know that you'll always be hardworking as a BZA student no matter what, and that you'll still graduate no matter what. Whatever knowledge/skills you feel that you're lacking in, you'll be able to go the extra mile and self-study them yourself. Wishing you all the best.",0,1744301250.0,Keitsubori,nus

Yes I know. As I have said, I am thinking of pursuing these minors to enrich my knowledge, not to work in those fields bruh. I aspire to work in the ML field, and I am thinking whether to diversify a little and do 1 minor, to have a broader knowledge range. Even if I do a minor, my Year 3-4 mods will already be very ML-heavy, which should give me sufficient preparation for my ML career, along with hard work, internship experience and my own self-learning outside of the course.

>you probably won't care/regret as much of whatever decision you make if you are currently a scholar, or your parents fully-funded your Uni education

chill bro its just 4 mods? Even if I don't end up enjoying it, it would still be a learning process for me to understand myself and my interests better. Its not life and death. I have done my research but those are just words on paper, how would I be able to confirm something without fully experiencing it?

>Cause you're certainly not able to do all 3 of them minors with your current workload.

yea which is why i stated in my post that i will only do 1 at most

>And based on that, trust your own gut, not other people one's.

Yea Im not asking anyone to make a decision for me or give me life advice lol. Just wanted to hear others share more about their experiences in the minors. I have done my research, but what I also wanted to know is how other reddit students feel about the minors, because those are things that I cannot find by looking at the job scope and curriculum alone.

>I don't understand your confusion. Nobody said you can't do both. I definitely didn't say that as verbatim.

>Now if it was me, and I clearly knew that ML is THE most important for my future career aspirations, I would just focus 100% of my spare UEs into ML

lolol look at how you contradicted yourself. No one told me that I can't do both. I am merely confused by your advice to fully focus on ML, and why I shouldn't do a minor just because my career aspiration is ML. What if I need to create ML models for economics research or for investment decisions? Everything is interconnected now.

I respect your opinion, though I am confused.

That one nusmods comment (from your link) is quite exaggerated as you can see from almost every other recent comments on nusmods talk about how their actual grades are B to A+.

One other thing you need to realize is that when people say “this course is really hard”, they usually mean “it’s really hard to score A/A+”, which is very different from saying “the course content is really hard”. This is the reality check for most “straight As” students as they realize this isn’t like O/A levels anymore, where they can rote learn their way to the top of cohort by mugging some TYS papers, and that among the cohort of other “straight As” students, they are really not that special.

I think in uni it gets increasingly hard to find friends. Because people just have their own life. You said you think the biggest source of happiness comes from friends, but you have no idea what a friend does. But you also said you want someone who cares for you and you care for. I think people care for people close to them. And to get close to someone usually means a common activity or shared interest to bond over first. Maybe communication is not your strength (it is admirable that you are trying to improve on this), but what are the things you do most of the time, can you do them with others? Like if you just study, maybe you can study with someone you know from proj work? Or when you eat can just jio someone you talked to recently, don't have to be close, if they eat with you then it's a good opportunity to train conversation skills, if not then no loss, at least you tried (and trained your rejection handling skills). If you don't want your life to be defined by studying, then you really have to examine your habits / time allocation. Maybe you can look at all the different clubs in NUS and try to find something that you think may interest you. Can just join to learn and feel the vibes. Even if you end up not feeling the vibes, at least you know you gave yourself a chance. An analogy is if you bought every single lottery ticket, you will confirm get the winning number. You will lose $ doing so, but what if every lottery ticket is free? So this is like initiating conversations with people, alot is heng suay one, cannot take it too personally, but you never know when you might win, and the cost is free (well, except for your time / effort), and not to mention the best and only way to train conversation skill is to just keep using it till you get better. And as uncomfortable and daunting as it might seem, it is kind of necessary to put yourself out there if you want friends, otherwise it is actually possible to get throught 4 years of uni without making a single friend, and I think that's quite sad. Even from a utilitarian perspective, the friends and network you build will probably be more important to your future career when you graduate than your GPA.

And in my connections with people, I seem to draw connections rather easily when have a more enthusiastic approach in life.

My point is, go out and enjoy life. Be interested in life. Because your posture in life shapes you. And you’ll eventually be someone who people are drawn to. For example, no one wants to be someone who is negative or a downer.

It was quite relaxed, back then it was on zoom although things may have changed now. I remember it was about 2 interviewers (or maybe just 1, cant recall sorry), they just asked generally things like why did I choose FASS, what is it that I like about my declared major and what do I already know about my major. The sensing I get is that as long as you present yourself to be interested in the major you are taking and in FASS in general, and show that you are not going in completely blind, they would be happy to accept you. I doubt you have to be an expert in your chosen subject matter, you are here to learn anyway

But I did Orbital and remembered that I love programming. I’ve worked on many different projects just because I like creating software. Luckily, my grades climbed a bit, and SUs came in handy. My advice is to take some mods you enjoy. Go learn a language (pre study over summer if you care about GPA). Go take some easy GE mods. 

Trust me Y1S1 was by far the worst sem I’ve ever had in NUS as a CS student. If you enjoy what you’re learning, care less about GPA and care more about how you can implement what you learnt, and create your own side project.

1jncw2q,am I doing something wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jncw2q/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,mknb2me,"If there is anything you are doing wrong, it is having this defeatist mindset because you are comparing yourself to others.

The way I see it, Y1S1 (regardless of major) is always one of the worst performing because everyone is taking the same basic introductory modules that expect everyone to know something about and the reality is that not only are the people in that course probably there for a reason (i.e.: interest), you are also competing with the better students on that age group.

However, uni is so much more than what you do in Y1. I've noticed that in later years when everyone starts taking more niche or specialized modules, this is where you can really start differentiating the ones with good general knowledge to those who are truly interested in a specific field of that major. I use PoliSci as an example: Y1 was brutal because everyone has a general idea of politics. However, it gets better at higher modules which are often more specialized because not everyone would be into political theory or international relations if their interest is more on public administration.

Of course, this does not mean that the competition dies off, but there are certainly times when you will perform better because you are in your 'zone'.

Also, probably securing good internships that showcase your know-how will probably go further than that CS kid who is putting all his faith on that full GPA. Trust me. GPA does not correlate to skills. You can be book smart but if you are bad at working in a team and focusing all your knowledge to only execute a narrow set of tasks that are often company specific, then you'll probably have troubles with the ""company fit"" aspect.

Bachelor Degree is almost considered a given (if you have it), so it starts playing a lesser role in favor of actual experience. Of course, having a good GPA is optimal, but it is so much more than just GPA.",6,1743403588.0,Pitiful_Emphasis_379,nus

I haven’t had the fortune of seeing otters yet, although generally there are regular sightings, but just don’t approach and you’ll be fine. 

I’ve seen wild boars maybe once or twice but strictly at the reservoir area known for it (upper and lower peirce), they were pretty far away and stayed away from humans. They were so far I really had no fear, just more of a “oh cool” situation.

Singapore is very much a city, wild animals stay away from humans in general, I actually had the same concern as you when I was younger and was considering traveling to other places (e.g. Australia..) to give you an idea. We do have a lot of insects though, but almost always harmless (e.g. cockroaches, moths, a lot of ants, tiny spiders generally non-toxic).",2,1743407091.0,hiimheh,nus

It's not very difficult to maintain a B average in DSA, especially if you're a scholar. Just do your best, and you'll be alright! The bell curve will pretty much be there throughout all of your courses, with a few exceptions.

2. Assuming you are an international student, I think campus stay for the first two years is guaranteed. After that, you may have to look for rent outside of campus.

3. No. Assuming you are a scholar, it should not be terribly hard. It won't be the easiest of things, but you'll manage. Again, just do your best!

My lecturer said that she will never ever give the highest tier to anyone.

1jk77ax,University of Hawaii at Manoa International Exchange potential newcomer questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jk77ax/university_of_hawaii_at_manoa_international/,mjsz40i,"Context: Friend went on exchange in UH Manoa (Amazing campus btw)

1. According to my friend the classes were much easier, they took a y3 course there which has similar difficulty to poly/y1 course in NUS for subjects in FASS. Take what you will from this comparison.

2. The gyms are free to use, there’s one in UTown and one in USC. Be aware that they are very crowded on certain days and times.

3. Unless you are taking a Language course or a Literature course, it’s extremely unlikely that the course will require textbooks.

4. Check your visas and exchange rules to see if you are allowed to do an internship, if not email NUS Global Relations Office to check. 

5. No. There are transit concession that can be bought but they are only worth in extremely specific cases where you need to commute 5 days a week. If you live near school there’s no need to get a concession.

6. Generally staying alone without a room/flat mate is extremely expensive. I would say the going rate is $1000-$1400 SGD per month. Getting on campus housing or getting a flatmate may be the better choice.

1jj5zxo,Questions from incoming PhD student,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jj5zxo/questions_from_incoming_phd_student/,mjl7dk6,"Hey! Welcome to NUS! I’ll try to answer your questions based on what I know as a current student (P.S. I'm a first year undergrad).

1️⃣ GPA Requirements

At NUS, the maximum GPA is 5.0. If your scholarship requires a 4.0 average, it means you need to maintain a B+ or A- in your courses.

PhD coursework isn’t usually too overwhelming, and since you're good at studying, you should be fine! The main challenge is balancing research with coursework.


2️⃣ Dormitory Availability for PhD Students

Yes, PhD students can apply for on-campus housing (e.g., UTown Residences, PGPR).

Acceptance depends on availability—first-year PhDs generally get priority, but it’s not guaranteed.

If your supervisor asks you to come earlier in June, you can apply for early accommodation, but approval depends on housing availability. Email NUS Housing Office ASAP to check.


3️⃣ University Health Insurance

NUS provides basic medical insurance that covers consultations at the University Health Centre and partial hospitalization.

It doesn’t cover major medical emergencies, so many students get additional insurance for better coverage (especially for private hospitals).


4️⃣ University Clubs & Sports

Yes! NUS has tons of student clubs, and PhD students can join most of them.

For football, check out NUS Football Club or recreational futsal groups.

There are cooking and tech-related interest groups as well. Look out for club recruitment posts on Instagram or Telegram when the semester starts!


5️⃣ Living on a PhD Stipend in Singapore

PhD stipends vary by faculty, but most are around SGD 2,000-2,700/month.

It’s possible to live on SGD 2K, but you’ll need to budget carefully:

Rent: ~SGD 400-800 (if staying on campus), SGD 1K+ (if renting outside).

Food: SGD 300-500 (cheaper if you cook & eat at hawker centers).

Transport: SGD 100-150 (public transport is affordable).

Overall, PhD students can live comfortably but not luxuriously. 

Tip: There usually are events in school where food accomodations (e.g. Buffets, lunch boxes, etc.) are given in excess. There's a telegram group chat that advertises if there are leftovers which you can take! 



6️⃣ Holidays & Work Flexibility

PhD students don’t have fixed annual leave, but it depends on your department and supervisor.

If you achieve good research results, most supervisors won’t micromanage you, and flexible working hours are common.

Some faculties allow remote work occasionally, but lab-based PhDs may need to be present more often.


🚀 General Tips & Making Friends

Join PhD student groups and student unions Telegrams (there’s usually a Telegram or WhatsApp chat for international PhDs).

Attend NUS welcome events—they’re great for networking.

Explore Singapore! There’s a great international community here, so you won’t feel isolated.


Hope this helps! Feel free to DM on Reddit or telegram if you need more advice, or just looking for a friend 😊!",12,1742868312.0,ReElliot,nus
1jj5zxo,Questions from incoming PhD student,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jj5zxo/questions_from_incoming_phd_student/,mjmwxbz,"Hi, to answer:

1) Depends on your background, but generally the modules are not extremely difficult, since some of the PhD modules are also catered towards the general masters students (i.e. more application oriented, if you are in engineering).

2) First year is guaranteed.

3) Usually around July is fine, but for June, you must speak to the dormitory office.

4) Not too sure about this.

5) Yes, but quite limited for graduate students.

6) Generally depends on your own spending habits. But, you can live a very decent life, if you mainly stay/eat on campus and once in a while eat out.

7) Depends on your own supervisor. Different supervisor has different expectations with regards to how much you have to work (or pretend to work).",2,1742901629.0,reddit_win1,nus

I guess the Singapore govt really likes an open market. What do you think of it? If Singapore limits the number of foreigners working in Singapore, do you think Singapore's competitiveness will be significantly impacted? 

You see, I'm going to go into construction, and I have the impression that a large proportion of the market is competing with quite a number of overseas construction companies, including the ones from a certain country which are able to undercut local and existing companies. What that means is that local/ existing companies in Singapore will need to offer construction services at lower prices, which means less profit for the company and less benefits for the staff, is what I think. But, it does benefit the economy right? Cheaper housing for Singaporeans. More economical for Singaporeans right? Isn't it a win-win?

I'm not sure for me, but, I do know it benefits Singaporeans. Should I just suck up with the relatively low pay compared to other industries, and do it out of the good will of my heart, or should I just go to whatever pays me the highest or reasonably well?

1ji2x27,Is Architecture a deadend course?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1ji2x27/is_architecture_a_deadend_course/,mjcvpks,"The problem of the industry can be seen in the course itself where the rich will get richer. In NUS, everything needs to be self sourced so there’s nothing stopping richer kids from outsourcing their models while kids from poorer background struggle with the little resources NUS Archi provides. Similarly, when they graduate, richer kids can either go to overseas masters in countries where architects are paid decently or start their own firms where they of course get the most $. 

Whereas, graduates who don’t have those options are stuck in dead-end associate jobs. Their starting pay might be deceptively somewhat okay compared to others at a glance (ard 4-6k) but that’s the masters graduate pay since it’s pretty much expectation to have a masters since you need masters to sit for architecture license (which is also another 2++ years of slaving away + exams while you’re working).  Even after you get your license, your pay will only increase by a few hundreds. 

Think you can be maybe the top student and get a good job? Well, Architecture in SG is where talent is not really wanted or appreciated, they just want obedient workers who will OT for free. I mean look at the poly cut off points, it was once like 3.7 out of 4 back in the 2010s then this year is jokingly low of just 3.2 out of 4, that’s a B/B+ average. Meanings all the top scorers from respective archi poly courses are all leaving the field. Like can you imagine working so hard in the course, being top scorers and then working for a firm 10 years later by that one classmate with shit gpa who copied their work off of the internet. And all that because that classmate dad was a rich architect/developer back in the 80/90s boom. The industry is fked.

I took interior archi advanced dip and decided not to continue studying that for degree as I felt that the time/cost ratio investment was not worth it;  bounced around in a few sectors and eventually went into IT (software development) as a project manager. I am working for built environment sector now, the company is looking for staff with archi/mechanical or civil engineering background but also with working experience/additional degree in other sectors across for a multitude of job roles (IT, civil engineering, sustainability), so archi is not deadend BUT you must think of branching out into other related sectors for work experience as companies nowadays are all about hiring unicorns for roles that have proper career advancement. 

 I am taking pt business degree now (project management) and my asking pay is equivalent to peers my age with an nus degree in engineering  and more than my peers with archi degree/masters, due to me pivoting to IT sector to gain work exp and also having background in archi that will specifically suit the job role. I may consider taking masters in project management or additional degree in information systems, don't think I can handle pt com sci with my workload haha.

Take CDE2501 or PF1101 for example. Signed it up with friends? HAH! The coordinators will split y'all up. You'll likely won't see your forced assigned group mates after the mod is done also due to differing faculties/majors. 

Can't say much about CCAs since I don't have the best track record, but I assume we're both in NUSCAS. Opinion: if you're not EXCO in that one it's hard too since there isn't... much to do there as a non-EXCO, to speak plainly. Not sure what else to say here.

Imo, the best shot at making friends will be from Y3 spec mods onwards. You'll be more likely to see the same people til graduation and so there is more room to connect. Bonus points since we already have a shared major experience.
Even making friends within our own major is tough since we'll get split up by how we choose to use UEs.

1jgjojo,Opinion on friends,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jgjojo/opinion_on_friends/,mj09oa1,"As an alumni whose school started during covid, here's a brutally honest comment, you're here to learn not make friends. 

Most students here are hi-bye friends for the sem, tbh i even had to evaluate whether it's worth talking and grouping with some of my peers, as useless peers will just drag your grades down, and if their grades are worse than you, you become their go-to for answers and help (the time you take to help them, will be in hours). 

I have a group that we still talk to and meet up on a regular basis. So how friends making goes are usually 2 extroverted people wanna make more connections and dragged their introverted friend who they somehow adopted. My close friend, I don't even recall how I became friends with him lmao, he just said I adopted him. 

So, my key advice is just be yourself, don't try too hard. Read or watch something during your break, maybe someone with common interest will see it and start talking to you. Don't be too weird or forceful in your convo, that will kill the vibe.

Lastly, I think right now you need a counsellor more than a friend, your mind is in a mess and your priorities aren't straight, not sure if you're facing acclimatisation issues or you're depressed which either way will need a therapist. All the best",7,1742577879.0,JExecutor97,nus

>RC4 pros: -a lot of computing students from what i’ve heard? so i get to know more people from my cohort & possibly ask for their help

Yep, we do have quite a number of CS students in RC4! RC4 generally attracts a pretty wide variety of students of different academic backgrounds so you should have no problem getting help and advice from seniors and friends.

 >-all rooms have aircon!!

Yep, all rooms in RC4 have aircon, though it's on a pay-per-use basis.

>-has a gym so yay easy to stay healthy

The gym is accessible to all students on a booking basis so you don't have to walk down to UTown!

>-systems thinking theme could help with training my problem-solving skills, which can be highly useful in my course + uiux design

Systems thinking is actually a really interesting concept when you consider just how much of the world around is comprised of systems - you can definitely apply it in problem solving skills!

> -they have a mental wellness space which i find really interesting; it seems like a relaxing place to chill when uni gets stressful 

Yes we do, it's called the Oasis! It's the one space in RC4 where we don't allow studying or academic work, it's purely a rest and relaxation stop for students similar to NUS' Pitstops. Really nice place if you want to just chill and chat with friends while lounging on beanbags!

> cons: -systems thinking sounds like quite a foreign concept. afraid that the modules may pull down my gpa.

Trust me, systems thinking may sound like a foreign concept (I would know as a FASS student) but it's actually really relatable! The profs in RC4 are all very helpful in helping students digest this abstract concept through real-world applications in our Junior Seminars and Senior Seminars, which range from topics about societal collapse, leadership, to even films!

>-arts scene doesn’t seem that vibrant, like i don’t see much about their art / dance clubs

This couldn't be further from the truth! RC4 has a really large arts scene, particularly in terms of performing arts. We have RC4ME (music bands), ORC4PELLA (acapella), R4D (dance), RC4 Theater (theater) and F4BRICS (fabrics) just to name a few! We also have a yearly event called Arts Night which acts as a massive showcase of the arts scene in RC4, and it's always a fun time for everyone!

R4D (RC4's dance Interest Group) holds open classes and teaches dances choreographed by our residents themselves. i know multiple people who initially joined the dance CCA as a beginner and very quickly mastered dancing as a passion. RC4 has many opportunities to perform dance items, such as Formal Dinner and Arts Night as this comment mentioned above!

as for musicians, we have had bands formed within RC4 that performed for NUS-wide/external events and one of them even got 2nd place for Supernova 2024. RC4 and CAPT also recently collaborated for a music event called Live Music Night (held just yesterday in the CAPT-RC4 dining hall!), where some groups from RC4 were playing their own instrumental arrangements involving the saxophone, flute, electric guitars etc. even within the RC4ME (RC4 Musical Expression) Interest Group, we have a lot of multi-talented residents. like i know at least 2 people who can play like minimum 5 instruments LOL and there's also Orc4pella, an acapella-singing Interest Group! besides performers, we have a few people who are very knowledgeable in band logistics, audio engineering and productions as well.

as for systems thinking, i would say don't worry too much about it as everyone more or less starts off on the same page. the concept is relatively easy to grasp after a while

also noted that you want to become a UI/UX designer or product manager in the future! not sure if this is applicable but RC4 has also recently started pushing a lot of entrepreneurship-related initiatives - one of our Senior Seminars is literally an Ideas to Pitches mod where groups of students work on pitching a business idea to several profs. RC4 also has a CogPod (club) called RC4Entre focused on promoting entrepreneurship-centric events and assisting students with creating their own start-ups. might be worth taking a look at!

Tembu mods r quite chill. Class size is small, like 15 people (so half of a secondary school / jc class). This is to encourage comfortable discussion, but I never felt pressured to give my opinion haha. Profs r very nice and content is interesting. For the mdds you're expected to write essays so yes its pretty humanities, but I'm sure you'll manage cause its like take-home assignments and not a level humanities exam type shi.

>  
i’d also like to know more about tembusu’s art / dance cca

Art CCAs: 

1. Yarn & Doodles (they do crocheting, shrink charms, slime making iirc)
2. tArt (usually tembusu interest groups start of ""t"" something. anyway tArt is painting and stuff. can see tembu website, they use Tembusu's art studio, Blank Canvas)
3. Tempo (music cca basically. a lot of freedom to explore. Use Tembu's music studio, The Abbey)

Dance CCAs

1. tCrews (they rehearse at the multi-purpose hall, dance prac is smth like 1mil studio HAHA but im not too sure cause I dont dance T\^T) 

> possible tips for writing our application essays such that it stands out?

  
As much as I'd love to help, Tembusians are very very diverse in background and that is not an accident. There is no template to follow for applications, so I would strongly suggest to just be yourself in your essay, as authenticity is hard to fake. Recall your life experiences and pick those that shaped you as a person and always link to the RCs ethos. You'll need to do research for this, so do go to the website to check out all the activities and what you're drawn to most. Would be helpful to identify where you can value-add to the college as that makes you a more compelling candidate. eg dance is my passion, insert any leadership experience, as such i see myself contributing actively to tembu's vibrant art scene in interest groups like tCrews.

  
hope it helps",1,1742614257.0,Several-Discussion-2,nus

Depends on whether you see your career as a means to an end or an end worth pursuing. There's good work to be done in both sectors, but unless you're a scholar, you're likely to progress faster and gain more valuable experiences working for private companies, who are constantly competing with one another to turn a profit and exploit new opportunities. 

On the other hand, public sector is comparably less hectic, but everything has to be approved by higher-ups and you will never be using the latest tools or technologies due to privacy concerns. There's more job security, but you'll still be at risk of being let go if you underperform and aren't full-time staff. 

In my public sector internship, I used OpenCV and SciPy to extract key events from audio-video recordings. It was my first time implementing computer vision, speech recognition and deploying my program as a local executable, so that was fun! 
I had access to a Jupyter sandbox environment, but had to wait a while to get all the libraries I needed approved and installed by my supervisor. From what I gathered from meetings, there are also opportunities to work on AI-related projects within the Microsoft / Azure Ecosystem, such as implementing LLMs to query document databases and extract insights from policy papers.

If you manage to get into any of the tech oriented stat boards like HTX, DSTA, CSIT or perhaps GovTech, I imagine that you'll get to work on even cooler projects too. If you find that you have interest in any of them and managed to secure an offer from them, I would recommend taking it up.

1jdt6da,ISB Driving Standards,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jdt6da/isb_driving_standards/,miqni5b,"Fundamentally, that's because the buses are shit to drive.   
NUS employs two types of electric ISBs - BYD and Zhongtong. 

BYDs are the ones that drive like any regular combustion vehicle.   
A force on the skinny pedal gives you an equal motive force.   
More step, more go. Less step, less go.   
Unfortunately, there are only 4 BYDs in the entire NUS fleet. 

Zhongtong makes up the majority of electric ISBs and they are shit to drive.   
There may be 4-5 inches of full accelerator pedal travel, but just using the first one inch can give you full motive force.   
That, coupled with an actual delay between when the pedal is pressed and when the motive force comes, makes it very difficult to smoothly pilot one of those things.

Furthermore, braking force is not even linear.   
The first application of the brakes on a Zhongtong nets you almost nothing.   
So most times, the driver panics (especially on a steep downslope stop like CLB or opp. YIH) and releases the brake once before pushing on it again instead of just pushing even harder.   
This then drives the bus into panic mode; it thinks you need ALL braking forces available and thus, even with 1cm worth of pressure applied on the brake pedal, you get full braking force. At 1cm of pedal travel.

Confused yet? 

Unfortunately, because each Zhongtong is multitudes cheaper than each BYD, therefore your chances of experiencing a shit ride are extremely high.

I'm not saying the drivers are great and that the machine is to blame - but understand that most drivers are here to earn a living by just simply driving, and not analysing how the machine works, or how to work around issues like these.",14,1742441796.0,700volvo,nus

Some may say its part and parcel of the NUS campus experience :) I recall some nausea-inducing rides myself. As a ISB rider and also a motorist on campus, sometimes i semi-jokingly thought the same as you.

Generally, the experience is the product of the hilly terrain, many curves, and tight service scheduling. What i think most likely happened is that certain routes may be more prone to congestion and/or delays, leading to drivers driving faster to make it up. The stretch of road behind PGP is also very windy and steep (its cut into the side of a slope) contributing to your experience.

Regardless, there have been very few accidents caused by a ISB over the last few years, and you must admit that it is far better for a bus driver to jam-brake rather than cause a accident.",8,1742308344.0,joeltan111,nus

1jdt6da,ISB Driving Standards,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1jdt6da/isb_driving_standards/,miqoutl,"Can't disagree that some passengers could be better at being a decent passenger.

Having driven both NUS and NTU ISB, NTU students are multitudes better.   
It is entirely possible to have a completely full-to-door bus and have 0 extraneous noises.

Meanwhile, all it takes is 5 NUS students to completely disrupt what is otherwise a very peaceful driving experience on a near-silent bus.

It's almost as if all bus-boarding etiquette is lost within campus.

You want better service from the drivers? How about try being a better passenger first?

1. If you wish to take the bus, flag for the damn thing. Don't stand INSIDE the stop - or worse; continue sitting on the benches expecting the bus driver to know that you want to board. We're not psychics. Driving into a bus stop and opening the doors to NOBODY is a massive waste of time. Understand that we have extremely short breaks between trips and we have to perform basic human functions like use the loo. Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.

2. Same goes for alighting. NTU students press the bell at every stop that they wish to alight, without fail. NUS students don't press the bell, the bus sails past the stop, and then they have the cheek to ask why never stop.  
Again, we're not psychics. Bell buttons exist, press the damn things. 

3. Boarding and alighting. If you see the bus pulling into the stop, the least you could do is be a bit proactive and move forward. You wanna take the bus, maybe start acting like it? If you take 3 seconds after the doors have fully opened and you STILL haven't boarded the bus, then maybe it's only right that the driver closed the doors in your face because it seems that you're not interested in boarding at all.  
Also, don't do shit like kiss goodbye or hug your partner with 1 foot in the door and the other foot on the pavement.   
Who are you to waste everyone else's time?   
A bus service exists to serve more than just one person so stop being an entitled prick and maybe work on your own character.  
Don't forget; after you people have alighted from the bus and returned to your cosy dorms and whatnot, we are the ones who still have to park the damn thing and rush for last bus/last train home. 

If everyone could be at least this much more civic minded I'm sure the ISB drivers would be much happier to serve you guys.

People who expect $100 worth of customer service from a $0 shuttle service is literally the most wayward Karen-ass behaviour that can come from what's supposedly a world-class learning institute.",6,1742442371.0,700volvo,nus

I had been waiting (standing) for the bus at UTown. The driver closed the door in my face, WHILE I was trying to board. The details are exactly as I commented previously. If any doubts can go ask for the case and review the bus CCTV footage (I don't remember which case# though, been a while)

Your points are valid regarding some students taking ISBs who really have shit for brains and idk who the hell brought them up or how they can even score sufficiently in anything with zero common sense to get into NUS cuz even animals know not to screw their own species over for no reason. My pet peeve is when there are multiple consecutive people running for the bus, like tf the bus timing is clearly stated in the nus nextbus/univus app, can't make it then wait for next bus or show up 1 min earlier to the bus stop??? Understand the entire bus load of people are being delayed as a result wtf. 

Fwiw they don't just act like this in bus though, in accommodations, canteens, class, gym also behave like fucking feral animals. Generally I try not to make it my business cuz I wouldn't have time to do anything if I tried to set every shithead I see straight, but I fucked a few of them over before when they directly messed with me too many times.

No experience with NTU, so no comment on that front, but agree people with sufficient smarts to get into NUS could and should use more than 2 neurons at a time in public interactions.

I don't make formal complaints to university infrastructure services unless someone really screws up BAD cuz I understand people are human also, but I expect humans to have bare minimum human level cognitive capabilities and I get pissy when they don't, especially if it's part of a job they are being compensated for.

Anyway thanks for holding on in there tho if you are still driving isb. I don't know how much they pay you guys, working conditions, contractual requirements, bus maintenance state or whatever internal stuff is going on, maybe bus maintenance or worn out suspensions are also a factor.

There is one thing I can tell you, although please don't take it at face value.

The only way you can fail a module is if you really try to fail the module, like not submitting all the graded assignments or missing tests. From what I know, different departments usually have their fail set at below 40% (anywhere between 35-40%) I think.

Your midterms has 30% weightage, so your score of 12 is already 12% of your final grade. You have 70% more to score from; if you only want to avoid failing, then aiming for a minimum of 33% from other components is your saving grace... which should be more than doable.

Isn't it better for them to stay in their own country and have some other deserving candidate take admission who could actually add something to the international character of the uni ?

You are an adult and you failed to do sufficient research on the nature of coursework masters programmes. Why is it the university's fault that you have a poor experience?

Also, to the mainland chinese masters students. 我明白你们大多数是没办法考进美国T10，所以得在新加坡读个水硕，然后回国内卷死。谢谢光临，有空再来哦, 我完全不介意你们英文水平 🤑🤑🤑。但你们既然已经在这里，不如好好趁这个机会提高你们英文水平？这里的英语背景应该比国内还好很多吧 🙃

He spoke to others in mandarin.

I an very sure he couldn’t even pass O level English, not to mention GP.

We asked him how he pass his English entrance test. He mentioned no need to pass the English entrance test to enter NUS. If fail the English entrance test, just take an English mod/subject in the first yr; nobody failed the first yr English.

Chinese gaokao system is how their students study,  including how they approach English.

For example , NUS (or any western universities) requires foreign students to have IELTS above 7.0 ( just an example) . Supposedly IELTS is measurement of your English efficiency, but to the Chinese, it's just another tests of memorization. Their main purpose is ""passing tests"" , not becoming English fluent. 

The Chinese will try and try again since they are 10-12 y.o , English tuitions centers will beat IELTS ""tricks"" and test-taking skills into their skulls. As long as they get their target 7.0 IELTS, they don't give a fk if they are speaking morse code to the Santi or they speak English. As soon as they pass, another ticks off their requirements and they will forget most of it again ( easily because most of how they pass is tricks and memorization). 

Many western universities can only view paper qualifications. But even if some Ivy league requires interviews, the Chinese students will approach the interviews with the same approach, tuition center prep practice until they have perfected answers to most usual interviews questions. After passing interviews? Same, everything returns to teachers, it has no use for them anymore.

Remember that their main goal ( or their parents)  is to ""study overseas in famous university so I can show off to my peers"" , not becoming English fluent or interested in studying finance or computer science or whatever subjects they are studying.",29,1742097861.0,lonesomedota,nus

I know exactly what many of you're talking about, I've seen it at my previous colleges too, very sadly there are a lot of Chinese students who never socialize with people outside their own circle and barely speak English or local languages at all. 

SG is one of my primary goals for my master study next year, I enjoy learning English, ofc it's not my native language, but I reached IELTS 7.5 without hardcore Gaokao style prep, at least I'm comfortable to count myself into the category ""fluent"" or ""competent"". 

After living in a Western country for so long, SG is very attractive to me on the emotional level (cultural diversity, English speaking while Mandarin is still useful, high quality education etc.) but I want to engage with people from all ethics and nationalities rather than fellow Chinese only - if that were the case, I can simply move back to PRC...

So I am a bit pissed that you are making this overarching statement. Personally I think that exchangers from continental Europe (Germans, French etc) are the most exclusive demographic in NUS due to their language, racial and cultural barrier. Your username has the word “parfait”. Êtes-vous français? 

Though to answer your question I think it really has to do with how English is taught in China. TLDR: All Chinese students that come to Singapore are English literate, but the issue is that English education in China is heavy reading and writing but less speaking IMO. Hence, you can get very paradoxical cases where Chinese students can read research articles but struggle to communicate in English. Thus, there may be a subconscious aversion to using English in the speaking medium (c’mon, who likes to be seen as less competent?), and since Chinese is widely used in Singapore to begin with + the existence of the wider Chinese international students in NUS = sticking to the Chinese groups.

By this metric, I also find Chinese Singaporean’s mandrin to be atrocious (no offense intended) since Singapore suffers from a similar situation as China with English education when it comes to Chinese (mother tongue) education, but you don’t see me mocking the Singaporeans for Chinese.",7,1742234489.0,WYP-3000,nus

Ever wonder why many Singaporeans, after working in China for years (or even decades), still cannot speak or type Mandarin like a PRC or Republic of China native?

When I spent 3 years in uni in Australia, I observed the same thing among Singaporeans, Malaysians, Koreans, Japanese, and Hongkies


They would all mostly mix around in their own group 


Singaporeans with Singaporeans, Malaysians with Malaysians, Koreans with Koreans, Japanese with Japanese, Hongkies with Hongkies, etc


Sure, there will occasionally be that one or two student who prefer to hang out with people outside of their group, but that's the exception not the norm


And sure, they don't necessarily shy away from interacting with people from other countries, but again that's the exception, they usually spend most of their time with their own group 


By and large, from my 3 years' worth of observation, that was how most people from those places behaved

Don't let it linger on your mind forever deciding whether you should pursue it or not.

Your use of the word ""punish"" is different than mine. I meant it more in the institutional sense, since the context is reporting them to NUS. Yours is a more figurative expression. So no, it's not a double standard since you won't get punished by NUS for expressing your emotions, but it's normal to get ""punished"" in that way for making social mistakes. I'm not saying it's justified, but it's not surprising.

Are you definite that the new people you are meeting are receiving bad gossip from that old gang? Are you sure that the common denominator isn't you that is somehow chasing the new people away? I'm not blaming here, I'm genuinely asking, and maybe something for you to reflect on. If you have a good connection with someone, generally they would not be so quick to dismiss you, and would give some leeway to the rumors they hear.

Again I'm still wondering what are you trying to achieve by reporting them. Do you hope that NUS would stop them from badmouthing you? Or is it because you haven't moved on? I'm 100% sure that if NUS somehow gets involved with them then the drama is only going to get worse.

And him telling them at my other CCAs that I'm banned at this CCA is just gonna make me look very bad esp if those individuals don't know me well yet. I noticed him doing that alot to people I am starting to be friends with/ talk more too, and the worse part is not knowing which people he had badmouthed me too. He keep spreading gossips and twisting information to make me look bad. Some of them are not even true. It made me feel like he is trying to turn people against me in other CCAs too. I don't even know what's the pt of even talking abt what happened at this CCA. 

But from the previous experience that resulted in the ban, I had learnt that sometimes it's best not to clarify my side of the story UNLESS people ask. If not, it may be seen as badmouthing others behind their backs or unsolicited trauma dumping (reason for ban). So now even when people ask, I just try to keep it brief and just say that I'm not on good terms with certain people.

1j9fd2v,Inquiry about CHS,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1j9fd2v/inquiry_about_chs/,mia5el8,"No. CHS curriculum is fixed.

52 MCs of Common Core 60 MCs of Primary Major 48 MCs of UEs

This equates to 160 MC for graduation requirements.

If you take a second major, it will count under your UEs. Second majors require 40 MC, so you'll be left with 8 MCs which you can use on other electives. If you are fine with overloading, you could take an additional 12 MCs (3 courses) and pursue a minor. CHS rule is such that you can take up to 3 minors, so overload to your hearts' desires if doing a bunch of minor is your thing.

Now, we have something called ""Double Counting"", especially between majors that overlap. Let me use PolSci and Linguistics as an example (since those two are my majors).

PolSci (PS) has a module called PS4220: Political Rhetoric. Linguistics (Ling) recognizes this module since rhetorics kinda falls under sociolinguistics. So, what happens here is that both PS and Ling majors can take this module and when they do so, it will count to the MC requirements of both majors, but it will only be reflected once. Hence, the system says you took 4 MCs, but both your PS and Ling requirements also go down by 4 MC since they are counted as ""completed"" under both majors.

In a sense, you could say that you cheated the system of 4 MCs and in this case, you can take one less module for Ling in this case (you'll do 15 PS modules \[60 MCs\] and 9 Ling modules \[36 MC + double-counted 4 MC\]). Of course, this dynamic depends on the module code. If the module code was ELxxxx (for Ling) instead of PSxxxx (for PS), then you'd take one less PS module.

Double-counting is confusing, which is why usually people don't bother with this. There are also some strict rules concerning double-counting. In some cases, you can only double-count two modules. In some cases, your major might require you to take a certain number of modules that fall under your department, which leads to another potential cause of confusion: ""recognized modules"".

Recognized modules essentially are what makes double-counting possible, but you are also allowed to take other modules outside of your majors and minors. For example, if you are a PS major, you could consider some Philo modules. Technically, they should fall under your UEs, but if they are PS-recognized (or recognized by your respective department), then they will count to your major as well.

Essentially, my tip as a graduating senior is to create a spreadsheet with every module you are considering listed along graduation requirements. For example, if you need to take at least 4 3k modules, then make a list where you have 4 3k modules. Best if you could label which group those modules fall under.

Assign an MC value to each module (4 in most cases) and just make sure that your final MC tally hits 160.

overloading is when you take >23 MCs in a sem. this is because you need 160 MCs to graduate, and you have 8 sems in 4 years, so 160/8 = 20 MCs per sem on average. therefore overloading lets you take more mods within the 4 years",3,1741830717.0,deadpoolherpderp,nus

This will depend a lot on your skills and abilities so I cannot guarantee you would have the same experience as me. Personally I had enough time to hang out with gf/friends/family around twice a week and it wasn't too stressful. Do plan your modules strategically like I mentioned though.

No you won’t die even if you do badly in Physics. I’m doing Engin with no physics myself, just need a bridging mod and some grinding. 

Yes you will have to grind. Everyone in NUS intelligent AF even tho it doesn’t seem like it/ they tell u they are dumb. Unless you okay with second lower 3.99/5 and below then u can just chill. Anything second upper and above means u gotta grind. 

Possible to balance work life? Honestly depends on how you define ‘balance’. I say for any course in NUS ppl I know and myself included no life for 6/7 days a week during the sem and just chill during summer breaks. Even then there are ppl finding internships. Unless of course, you don’t rlly care about grades and portfolio. 

Do we make stuff? Depends on your mods, FYP etc. short answer is most probably yes. Majority of Engin requires 3D modelling skills (they will teach you). Most Engin also have lab work.

Would you struggle? Not necessarily. I’m assuming you got an A in H2 Math? That’s plenty good enough as a starting point into most of the math intensive classes you will face in most of the engineering courses. 

Workload wise, I would dare say it is manageable, provided you put in consistent effort throughout the semester and stay on top of your classes. Try to not leave everything to recess week, otherwise you will suffer. Ask questions often to professors and classmates.

Coming from chemical engineering, you don’t get to 3D model and “make stuff” as much as the other engineering (Mechanical and Biomedical off the top of my head). Lab is fun! Know what the purpose of the experiment is for, and everything should fall into place. But I’m not sure if the general engineering course can lead to chemical engineering as one of the options, so definitely consider if that is the only major you wish to apply for.

To my knowledge, NUS CDE is making changes to a lot of the curriculum for engineering mods so you have more opportunities to explore core engineering concepts rather than fluff mods. below are some changes that i know of to the mech eng syllabus:

me3123 = half of 2135 + half of 3122 (removed potential flow)

me2121 include 25% of 3122

me2116 = half of 2112 + half of 2114

The offer of Master came from your school. Scholarship, loans, bursaries etc come from Office of financial aids. They are 2 different depts/entities.

I do believe you have to submit a lot more forms, information, details, documents, write-up etc for scholarship.

Look at nus website for NUS Office of Financial Aids for more details eg schedule of application, type of scholarship etc.

My thoughts (and opinions):
Many universities are worried you cannot fund your study or activities (eg overseas exchange programs) and have to stop your study half way. They frequently ask how are you funding your study (or xxx activities) before they offer you the program (activity). So when u choose/click only “scholarship” you gave an impression that you have obtained a scholarship for the master program you applied. Note that your application is an application for admission; not an application for scholarship. They are normally 2 separate applications. I think you misunderstood the offer of master program comes with scholarship if they offer you. Even with gov scholarships, u hv to apply to respective gov dept n university separately.

Check nus website for financial aids and see how to proceed or write to the financial aids dept for clarification.

Perhaps you can try to get a RA role in the university, you can reach out to professors in the dept whose interests align with yours to check if they have openings, mention that you are an incoming masters student. They are paid decently, and you can use your salary there to finance your studies.

But it's good that newer batches won't need to take 2 different mods cause the requirements are retarded, or at least I never understood why it couldn't be double counted.

IE2141 being gone is a good riddance, well at least for the future intakes. The shift to having more space for core mods is definitely a plus, since currently we are now forced to burn our UE space for that, which could have been used for actual non-major related.",25,1741103813.0,HexagonII,nus

Like u/JouleV has said, very very good changes for CEG. More core mods and less fluff mods is a big step in the right direction for CEG, whose common curriculum has been rightfully criticised for being filled with too many fluff mods.

1j3chu7,Shortened CDE Common Curriculum from AY 2025/2026,https://i.redd.it/7hfqwyb0some1.jpeg,mg0k4wr,"Appears to be a huge shakeup of the ME curriculum alongside the changes in CDE.  New Batch must take the following Core Mods: 

* **ME1103 Principles of Mechanics and Materials (NEW)**
* **ME2105 Principles of Mechatronics and Automation (NEW)**
* ME2102 Engineering Innovation and Modelling
* **(offered from AY2026/27 onwards) ME2116 Mechanics of Materials (NEW)**
* ME2121 Engineering Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer
* ME2134 Fluid Mechanics I
* ME2162 Manufacturing Processes
* (previously ME2115) ME3112 Mechanics of Machines 
*  **(offered from AY2026/27 onwards) ME3123 Applied Thermofluids (NEW)**
*  (previously ME2142) ME3142 Feedback Control Systems
* **ME4101A B.Eng. Dissertation**



1. Appears that ME1102 and ME2104 (EPP1&2) will be retired. Not sure if there will be EE stuff taught to the newer batch, I suppose ME2105 would cover a bit of that. ME1103 is an interesting change, its name hints of a return to the era of 10 years ago where students took EG1109 Statics And Mechanics Of Materials. Wonder what will be covered in ME1103, hopefully it provides a better bridge from JC to the other core mods than what ME1102 does now.

2.  Other modules removed - ME2112 Strength of Material (probably replaced by ME2116)

3. Another brand new mod appears to be ME3123, which also counts to the Aero specialisation together with ME2135 Intermediate Fluid Mech (technical elective). I suspect that ME2135 may eventually be retired. Interestingly, this is also a return to the old era, where all ME students had to take 2 fluid mods -  ME2134+ME2135 as core mods.

4. The 'upgrade' of several level-2000 mods to level-3000 mods is interesting. I wonder why.

5. One thing to note for 'Integrated Project' is that it isn't really removed, it just has been moved from CDE common curriculum to the respective major's curriculum.  If ME continues to include mods like MA1513 etc. as major requirements, the increase in 20MCs of major mods will probably mean: +8 (FYP) +4 (ME3123) +8 (extra TEs - total 3 TEs required instead of just 1 under the old syllabus)

Depends on type of job and competition. Govt agencies/statboards - maybe. Usually second upper if sufficient for most places, but some jobs look out for good grades for certain core modules (e.g algorithms for quant).

\> Just to confirm can drop with W grade by second sem reading week right?

Refer to NUS website

\> How much time do you spend per week, and is your project research based / SWE / lab work?

Depends on nature of project... Algo/theory, can be as little or much as you want to. Some FYP are basically free labour for profs/lecturers to create course software/websites (often from scratch). Sometimes, you may be assisting PhD/postdocs to write code for research experiments. I think treat it as a 4-6MC module, so in theory, you should be spending around 10-15 hours per week.

\> Would doing internships during the semester instead of FYP be better?

It depends on your goal. If you ever want to do a research career, you should do a FYP. No one can advise you regarding this with the info you provided, your best bet is to consult your cohort academic advisor.

\>  Is it manageable to juggle both?

Probably not. If you aren't able to do both tasks well, you might be wasting everyone's time. Remember that FYP is basically a research mentorship program, and if you don't put effort into it, you are wasting your advisor's time.",2,1740889483.0,requirem-40,nus

1. When I apply for internships, few (<5%) ask for my GPA. Those that ask, will just ask for numerical GPA and not really the class. So it probably will not affect much. UNLESS it's public sector, your class will probably determine your starting pay

2. Yes

3. Depends on how much effort you want to put in. I really want to do a good FYP, so I underloaded and spent most of my time doing the FYP.

1iz9axo,Shanmugam re-posts Ben Leong’s comments on GST and inflation,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iz7hon,mf2tyd0,"I write this knowing I'd get downvoted to a place deeper than the abyss, but this is just my two-cents as someone who has lived in Europe, the Philippines and Singapore and for the record, I am a Singaporean, so I do pay GST and all that stuff.

As much as Ben Leong's post relied heavily on cherry-picked points to make a claim and that it was very unfiltered, the points brought up do make sense. One simply cannot blame rising GSTs and saying that it is turbocharging inflation. I think many here are missing the biggest point that sets Singapore apart from most other developed countries, and that is us having some of the lowest taxes in the world.

GST at 9% would make any European country blush and feel euphoric. Our income tax brackets are also some of the lowest. Just be happy that you are not being taxed as much as 42% for earning an amount equivalent to 66.760€ annually as is the case in Germany. Of course, nobody wants to pay more taxes, but Singapore still needs to get money from somewhere so that it can continue giving everyone free payouts despite everyone mocking the whole concept of a welfare state.

The real culprits here are those who decide the price of goods. Like Ben Leong said, sellers can decide to charge more than what is necessary for the sake of convenience. Now, imagine that most fresh graduates are also securing higher entry pays, the fact here is that comparatively speaking, on top of paying less in income taxes and other taxes (less those who own cars), Singapore also has some of the most competitive salaries in the world and I don't say this because I am some ultra-patriotic Singaporean; while Singaporeans cry about getting an offer less than S$4,000, most fresh graduates in Europe are settling for 3,200€ before taxes and before some smart-aleck makes the false comparison that euros are worth more than sing dollars, just remember that a McDonald's meal in some of Europe's largest cities go for 9€; just saying in case some of you think that $6 is too expensive.

Even in comparison to countries like the Philippines, while 22,500 pesos (S$546) sounds cheap, just remember that this is a country where occupations we consider as ""atas"" earn relatively low. A licensed dentist could earn as little as 39,000 pesos montly and with their annual income of 468,000 pesos, they pay 22,500 pesos + 20% of the excess above 400,000 pesos in income tax, on top of the VAT being at 12% (higher than Singapore's GST), and before someone brings up the ""lower cost of living argument"", just remember that a middle-class Filipino household is also earning disproportionately lower than a middle-class Singaporean household minus the perks of having decent government housing grants.

My point here is that Singaporeans generally enjoy a higher disposable income but are too blind to appreciate the fact that our position is far better than what nationals in other countries are in. Of course, one could argue that in places like Europe, the welfare state provides basic services for free; but come on, unless you are chronically ill, you're effectively paying off someone else's healthcare bills and I can imagine Singaporeans would be pissed off if the government decided to slap everyone a 42% annual income tax and 20% GST to provide these welfare services that Singaporeans always love to use as excuses as to why Europeans have lower disposable income; as you can see, it is a vicious cycle that would make a layman Singaporean pissed off regardless where you are on that cycle.

Of course, Ben Leong did cherry-pick and did not address every single thing that Pritam said in parliament, but the point here is that raising GST was already long overdue. The pandemic simply sped it up because those masks and vaccines weren't free. In fact, I'd even say we're lucky that we are receiving payouts from the government while many other so-called developed countries can only dream of receiving government payouts unless they are unemployed, disabled, or retired and on government pension.

Some backstory is that I couldn’t find a spot to study as it’s usually all taken up after my lessons and happened to stumble across a really isolated bathroom with a really strong fan near hon Sui Sen library and computing one day. It has been my secret spot for the last 4 years and I really appreciate the hours I had to myself in there. 

I remember setting up my portable table and studying there. Really some of the most focused times I have ever had and helped me improve my grades tremendously.

Sure, someone will occasionally come in and take a poop next to me and make the toilet smell like ass. But I also see it as an opportunity to talk to and socialise with multiple different people anonymously (I’m shy).

1iyip8w,Affordable external counselling recommendations if unable to resolve issues at UCS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1iyip8w/affordable_external_counselling_recommendations/,mevr5wj,"I've been seeing your posts for a while now. You definitely need to see a psychiatrist (not a psychologist).

With your abandonment trauma, low self-esteem and really intense emotional reactions, I highly suspect you have Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD). Please note this is completely different from bipolar, people always mix those up. I'm referring to BPD.

My older cousin has BPD and you remind me of her a lot. Life was impossible with her because she took everything so personally. She remembered every single grievance done against her in great detail since she was 5 years old. Everyday repeat those old stories ad nauseam. ""When I was Pri 3, my best friend refused to lend me her pencil in maths class on 10 Apr"" blah blah blah. Even though we tried to help my cousin, it was so draining to be around her as she was a vortex of negativity. 

if I made the mistake of asking her ""How are you?"" on Whatsapp, it would unleash a barrage of paragraph-long texts where she constantly complained about why her friends and family abandoned her. Ironically, it was her tendency to trauma-dump that led people to avoid her. I really tried my best until I couldn't take it anymore.

Luckily my aunt shelled out the money for her to get therapy. At first my cousin was misdiagnosed as having depression, and the meds did nothing for her. It was only when a senior psychiatrist suggested BPD that the pieces began to fall into place.

Now my cousin is a much happier and nicer person to be around, and she has a husband and several friends. She still has episodes but she has the tools to manage them now. Highly, highly suggest you ask your parents for the money to help with this, or do Grab for a few months until you have the money for treatment.",14,1740576487.0,Inevitable_Theme_718,nus

1iyip8w,Affordable external counselling recommendations if unable to resolve issues at UCS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1iyip8w/affordable_external_counselling_recommendations/,mfa63f2,"Hmm the instances u had mentioned about ur cousin does sound very extreme. I think my is much milder, if I do indeed have BPD. 

Tbh, I did suspect I have BPD, as certain traits like fear of abandonment, chronic emptiness and intense emotions resonate with me growing up. I mentioned to my psychologist back in 2018 that I suspected I have BPD then too as I am quite emotionally reactive and have depressive episodes that's triggered by conflicts in relationships. I was also known to be oversensitive since young. I've also identified with other labels growing up like hypersensitive person (HSP) and emotional sponge as I tend to absorb ppl's emotions around me and can feel them pretty strongly (enhanced empathy idk?). I've booked an appointment with IMH but my first appointment is scheduled only in October so I gave mainly been reading self-help book on resolving abandonment truama such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) in the mean time 😭

Tbh, my parents especially my mum aren't keen in me seeking psychotherapy and taking anti-depressants so for the first few years after my OCD and generalised anxiety diagnosis, where I had to take anti-depressants, I couldn't eat the medicine infront of them without getting scolded and nagged as my parents always believe that medicines in general, especially psychiatric medicine is bad for health. They didn't understand why I needed to take them or why I had my conditions as they felt that I have everything, even things they didn't have growing up, shelter, food, money, education etc and so couldn't understand why I was depressed or anxious. 

This was also why I was nvr brought for therapy even thought my anxiety, OCD, and suicidal thoughts had manifested very early on as a kid, back in primary school, where some rituals include writing every thought down so I would hide a paper and pen under my pillow and scribble secretly every night and was scolded very badly everytime they found out about it.

I also had a very bad case of shyness/social anxiety where I was too afraid to greet neighbours/strangers (or even look them in the eyes) when we bump into them in the lift despite getting scolded and canned after I get back home as my parents said that it is extremely rude. I had this phobia of saying hi and bye to even my friends all through high school. I also didn't dare to play with other kids in the playground and would stay at home all day staring at the wall as my parents didn't allow me to use the computer or watch the TV.

Because my mum is also very obsessed with how ppl view her, she doesn't like the idea of me talking to my counsellor/ psychologist about the excessive pressure I went through growing up. When my psychologist talked to her back in 2017 that she needed to reduce her control and stop being so hard on me, she got really mad and scolded me when we got home. Since then, I nvr talked to her about counselling and my psychologist also said that there's not much they could do if my mum isn't willing to listen. I was advised to move out and stay on campus in university. However, because of covid my entire first year was online, so i didn't apply to stay online as I felt it was waste of money. Even though I wanted to stay in halls/RCs in Y2, I felt there was no pt even trying because of how competitive halls and RCs were. So tbh, not staying on campus is one of my greatest regrets.

Because my mum is very obsessed with how others view her, it was also why since young, I needed to present the perfect image to others, and why I was being caned for every mistake made in test as perfectionist is the standard to her. She would also always compare marks with neighbours and friends and would get upset and mad that I'm not performing as well as her friends kids. When I confided to her about the bullying incidents where my bullied had nearly drowned me in the swimming pool or when my bullies try to throw me off the building by lifting me and using brute strength, she just laughed and told me they are just having fun with me. When we meet my cousins and her friends kids, she would always shame me that I am unable to stand up for myself and am ""even bullied by girls as a guy. Next time go NS sure die"". Since then, I nvr told her about the bullying anymore and nvr felt like it was worth telling her about my mental conditions and struggles.",-1,1740763070.0,11thForm-DeadCalm,nus
