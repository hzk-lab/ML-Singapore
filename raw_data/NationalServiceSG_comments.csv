Hi guys, I will be enlisting at this month and got a couple questions to ask:) 

•First, Im a Singaporean but I literally don’t have any relative and any place to live in sg (complicated reasons haha) so what should I do when I book out or something 

• As the question above, I seldom back to sg so I don’t even have a bank account for the ns allowance :(  anything required to register a bank account?  ( I don’t have a billing address)

• Anything compulsory to bring when enlistment? Like not the things they told us to bring, more like essential things, and do we need to bring powerbanks or the wall charger is currently allowed? FYI I’m c2 bmtc V due to my asthma

i also missed by a few weeks a 72255 sms from cmpb on mar 3 which said ""message from cmpb... reply within the day to view msg"" i didnt know there was such way of contacting me so thats why i missed, i think the sms was about asking me to upload medical docs to onens which i cant cuz it says no access

(i also got a notif for thing to do on my onens dashboard abt manage medical matters thing but i click inside say no access when trying to upload some docs/doing questionnaire , the notif then disappeared after a few days)

emailing will probably take long to reply so i guess ill call, ik its a 24h hotline but idk if i shld do it in the day where got more people to help check or smth or at night where theres less calls so they might focus more on my case since not many calls in the day. I also have the idea of going down to cmpb in person to basically ask what i would ask in the hotline call but idk if i can do that

But if anything, you could 'try' get PES B4 and experience the best of both worlds—combatant but with ""handicap privileges"" (Source: Me, a PES B4 Combat (II) Medic)

That being said, what another guy commented here is true—you have to be 100% sure that it's something you  want and can live with for the rest of your life cause you'd be doing things that you'd otherwise wouldn't be doing as a PES C9 even after NS. You'd be doing IPPT every year till you hit MINDEF Reserves; you'd be more liable for call-ups for whatever Reservist as a combatant than combat service; and the list goes on.

He got posted to ST and appealed to go to command school, but due to limitations, he remained there as a trooper. Despite this, he did his best still and contributed wherever he can within his capacity, leading to him being promoted to CFC. 

Sure it’s below any commander rank and it is literally 4SG or local sergeant, but if you are looking from a perspective from a command school “reject” it was pretty impressive and is a testament that his will remained strong despite the setback. 

This is in contrast to another platoon mate I had, who was flexing about how he could drop everyone else in CLM when we were only white stripes. Unfortunately he only got in because his SOFUN led him to being the Platoon Best, which automatically puts him for OCS. His innate lack of integrity led him to being bounced from the course. 

So tbh I don’t care what vocation or rank you get during your NS tenure, but so as long as you are doing what you set out to do, I have the utmost respect for you.

Went to multiple army career programs and experiences. Set my path to sign on as an officer. After BMT, I got my posting, instead of OCS, it was SCS. Was extremely heartbroken. My applications for the air force as a ground base air defence officer and senior military intelligence expert in the DIS were also both rejected. 

 But through my training in SCS and looking back on my BMT experiences, perhaps it was a good thing I didn’t become an officer or enter OCS. In BMT, I tried to lead but often it wasn’t good. Messing up foot drills and commands, being so shagged out in outfield till it became how I can survive rather than how to help everyone. Even got dismissed as platoon IC in less than 24 hours. SCS maybe I was a little more competent but fitness and coping under stress was difficult.

Fast forward till today, I am a 3SG but posted in a very chill place. Somewhere I have no men under me. I am fortunate to be where I have been posted to. I still regularly look back to think of what could have been since I had a dream and goal for 2 years which didn’t happen. A person like me isn’t fit to lead men that’s what I think to myself.

Was from the PTP batch, did not make it to command school, ended up being a TO in TPT Hub West, posted to Pasir Laba camp. The irony was that I became the TO for SCS and OCS, meaning that I had to support them on their outfields and activities like IPPT, SOC, and other forms of trainings. 

  
The best part of it was that compared to being in a ""chiong sua"" unit, all I had to do was drive my OUVs, 5 Tonners or Landrovers to support the SCS and OCS cadets, and I didn't have to do much while the cadets were carrying out their trainings. Mentally it was exhausting, being out at Tekong with the SCS / OCS cadets for exercise grandslam / centipede for 7 days straight without having much to do. 

  
But my key takeaways were that I probably had it lucky, even though i was stumped that i did not make it to command school. I was able to forge relationships with many of the SCS trainers and COs of the respective schools, the Wing Comms of the various OCS wings, and even went overseas with them a few times. Being a support personnel, they tend to treat us more like friends and give us more leeway as well, without the regimentation. Did not regret being a TO at all, I even managed to clock enough mileage to get my class 4 license when i ORD-ed (I alr had a class 3). Through all these, I really got to see the good & bad regulars, dealt with COs and ISOs, and it really showed me how the armed forces also works like a corporation, and has its own politics as well. 

  
All in all, my take is that command school isn't the end goal in the Army, especially if you're only serving 2 years. What's better is how you make the best of your situation, to have a fruitful and fulfilling 2 years of service.",9,1744277538.0,_DaShaoYe,NationalServiceSG

He is not being rewarded by being excluded from the tasks, he is being kept away from the rest of you so you don't end up fighting or arguing or harassing each other while you have work to do. Of course him not doing the work is sort of a 'reward', but is he really doing absolutely nothing?

I had to deal with many such people before. Keep complaining about everything and make everyone hate him. The only solution is to separate them from everyone else. Then everyone will hate them, but everyone already hated them so there is no loss or gain. At least you all whole lot don't start to fight or argue while doing the tasks, because that fight is going to waste my time, your time, and the task isn't going to be finished. Want to argue go and do it in admin time or outside, I dont care.

On the other hand, I agree with these NSF commanders in the thread. If he is reporting something and an action is being taken, clearly there is something actionable being reported. You may think what you talk about is harmless banter, but maybe he was offended in some way. This one you all ownself need to settle.

We have 2 intakes, JC intake in the second half of the year is shorter because of uni stuff. This means that unlike the poly batch, you guys don’t have BTP.
 
What we usually see is most of the JC recruits are generally quite fit, unlike poly which has more time to train up. 

Your physical fitness and IPPT score will be a bigger consideration for whether you get into JC intake. Pull-ups are used in the BAC fitness assessment during BMT. Train up a lot, good luck.

Also an additional note, telling them you will sign on after getting in means nothing. They’ll think you’re cute. Most of the regulars in BMT have signed on before even getting into CDO as there is stricter criteria due to higher security clearance in SF and it’s a lot harder physically to pass ranger and SF than going through your red beret journey.",6,1744218623.0,Wet_Melon,NationalServiceSG

i say properly because i didn't pass till i did so. frequently practicing timed trial of 2.4km is not enough. you need to train for more than the test distance to build consistent endurance and train your lungs.


training 2.4km in your own time is very different to test day. you need to account for the expended energy from static stations into the body conditioning. therefore, endurance is key, both physical and mental.

test day - differs from person to person. some have strong control over their physical and can start slow. others, like me, start slow but end up expending more energy in doing so. you have to find out about your body in that way.

know your form, get it right & most importantly know your body too. over training can fuck u over. rest properly between sessions.


especially between stations, don't let the stress of failing beat you. one station at a time. 100% for each, and you will make it in the end.",1,1744215006.0,Initial_Piano_9407,NationalServiceSG

Previous Pes D guy here (now Pes B1)
Answer is you wait, maybe 1 month or 2, before you start emailing them. (They should state some date somewhere, if not maybe wait 1 month)
Due to being PES D, you will either need to provide more medical documents, or go for further more in depth checkup regarding whatever problem you have.
Check your OneNS regularly, they should state status regarding what they are doing now.
Due to your Doctor Memo, i wld not be surprised you get non-combat role, so PES B and below. This means no need to do IPPT and you can just wait for enlistment letter or whatever.

1. They contribute to the economy a lot, the government wants to bring these sources of money into our local economy with incentive.

2. Declining fertility rates in Singapore, yes there is an underlying issue to why Singaporean fertility rates are declining that can’t be addressed simply as injecting population through PRs. But it’s a thing many countries do, our PRs at least have money, work, and don’t live off of benefits.

3. Security clearance, they aren’t as ’indoctrinated’ as 2nd generation PRs.

Any kind of national service or other volunteering schemes like SAFVC (SAF) and COP (SPF), would only be possible if you manage to attain PR status.

For now, maybe you can try volunteering in community stuff under PA or the local community centres.

>I got some intelligence experience so I can maybe do intel for police or gov.

Those kind of careers are certainly only open for Singapore Citizens (not even PRs). Even then, they are very competitive and demand rigorous background checks as well (which could be problematic for a new citizen).

From your profile, you used to be from the British civil service? In the same way, I'm sure a Singaporean isn't going to be considered for MoD/Home Office or MI5/MI6.

Basically after consulting with people from both SAF and non-SAF, I figure that UpPes is not likely to align with my career goals, and having a meaningful NS is not necessarily about whether you are in a  combat fit vocation, but is also making use of what you have and your current position, which is why I seek interest to become a ASA Specialist and got the position.

And using my time both in the office and as a stay out, I used it to seek and improve my personal hobbies and skills, as well improving my working and communication and stress management skills around people and the working environment. 

Not only that, I managed to meet plenty of people in both BMT and my current camp who have time to give me sound advice and lessons that a combat fit vocation might not otherwise. While the urge to UpPes is still there, I remind myself of everything I have now and appreciate that I have time and resources to do it as an ASA Specialist.

You will regret it. I was in the Navy as a NSF and heard all kinds of stories from disgruntled regular officers. 

The difference between scholars and farmers is huge. Very common for scholars to be LTCs by their early or mid thirties. As for farmers, imagine being a 40 year old Major. Farmers are bound to be discontent at the scholar promotion track.

I was from there and here are some tips:

1. Make sure you’re fit, you don’t have to get divers gold (90pt) for now as they will train you in CDC, however in all do get in you must be at least a silver in BMT (75)

2. Make sure you are comfortable in water, your BMT is different as your IFC is only 3 days. However there would be a lot of water activity that you have to pass to make it into CDC, firstly make sure you complete your lifesaver (5 min tread water , 3m jump, 500 m swim, make a float with your uniform). Those that did not pass would not even be considered for CDC and would get posted to larger navy, medic, AQC
 
3. Get use being uncomfortable, since you’re gonna be manage by alpha wing, some of the instructors there are really passionate and that comes at a cost. They would be harder on you in an effort to teach you as well as the fact that they are preparing your for CDC such as the induction day where it was just hammering and making you get wet and sandy.

when you get posted out, there may be some areas where the beds and bunks are airconditioned. guardrooms are one example, if you become an ST. another example is duty/ops rooms, the duty personnel often sleep in the aircon office. but it's more rare.",147,1743651511.0,ObsidianGanthet,NationalServiceSG

Now technology dam power, until the old encik saying ""eh recruit your helmet got Aircon is it""  has now become a reality. Your enicks and sgt will teach you how to set up the portable helmet/ aircon unit on the first day of BMT. 

The SAF is trying to make the jockey cap version of this to match the saying ""eh recruit your jockey cap got aircon is it"" but we are still far off cause jockey cap too small to fit all the CU and FCU parts to make a good aircon unit. Alpha testing has begun in a few units, but results seem bad, and they will need to review the design, so look forward to having the aicon jockey cap variant in 5-10 years.

So now whenever encik screams at you for wearing helmet when after he ask you to take off and he says eh recruit your helmet got aircon is it you must answer yes encik my helmet got aircon.

For running, you have to do 2 types of exercises. Long distance and intensive intervals. Running will be the most shag one. If you're in a combat unit, you should just try to see how tired you are.

Cadres do shout and scream, but they definitely do not abuse their power. If they do anything which you feel is unfair for you, you can technically report them.

1000 counts of punishments means 1000 counts of any punishments they want, push up, sit up, flutter kicks you name it. The reason why it’s up to 1000 counts is because the punishment can be compounded. Not enough time for the day? Never mind, tomorrow continue.

He then proceeded to make my life hell literally. I was condescended in every way possible and made to do ridiculous tasks SOLO. I was assigned more than 16 days guard duty with certain times back to back timeslot which I know was illegal. I highlighted the issue to him and his response was ""sorry ah paikia(supposedly I'm a dick for making a complaint) our unit manpower is very low, 4 going to ORD (in 4months time) so u just have to suck it up. I did, until the day whereby everyone has to submit their early leave form.

​

Everyone knew the kind of shit I took during that period and they were empathetic, so when I told them that I was going to take Christmas eve and Christmas to celebrate with my then girlfriend, everyone avoided taking that day just to avoid clashing with mine, which I appreciated. Fast-forward to the day when that encik reviewed the leave application, instead of speaking to me privately he chose to put on a show in front of my other colleagues.

babi-cik: ""Mr. ho, why u want christmas eve and christmas?""

me: ""because I intend to celebrate it with my girlfriend""

babi-cik: ""why christmas only need to celebrate, what if I don't give u those 2 days?""

me: ""can I have 1 of those 2 days instead? just 1 of either 2""

babi-cik: ""nehmind la, if u cannot celebrate i help u celebrate with her la""

​

I usually won't bother to aruge with him because I know that I have much more to lose than him, but back then my tolerance towards disrespect of my girlfriend was pretty low, that's why i answered back;

​

me:""ok encik, if u want to make my life difficult I will also.""

babi-cik: ""Mr.ho, you threatening me issit? U see how many witness i have here""

me: ""not threatening you encik, but don't too much""

babi-cik: ""fuck u understand, who do u think u are blah blah blah..now i tell u, u can forget about your leave.""

​

He then proceeded to amend that month's duty roster, and put me on duty back-to-back on 24/25 DEC 2010.

I went straight to the medical center, I told the MO that I don't want to drive anymore, that I'm stressed out and done with driving. Was issued temporary excuse driving and arranged for an appointment at MMI, where I was interviewed by a Major and told him everything. Was given 2 days off and when I returned to the unit I was called for an interview with the CO, S1 and that bloody fucker, It was a no-holds-barred meeting where the CO told me to voice out all of my displeasure. I took the chance and went after everything he's done to the unit and me personally. CO and S1 then told us to put the past behind and to move on, which I rejected and proposed to them to send me back to my original unit which they reluctantly accept. (because i told honestly if I'm still in that MT-line, I will not drive, because I still have 60 days excuse driving from the camp MO and a 2nd scheduled interview at MMI to access my situation) .

Yes, I fucked him and his duty roster for that month. sure I'm sorry that because of me, the other guys had to tank the disgusting shit-show but that was the best damn decision that I made back then during service. I was posted back to my old unit and ENJOYED the rest of my army journey till the day I ORD. wanna know what's funny? When I was preparing for ORD and had to run around to get the signatures from officers and all, I found out that that asshole was transferred out of the unit/formation that he was SO PROUD of and was thrown to become a logistics sai-kang encik of my transport hub. The look on his face when I saw him and how dejected he was when I was going to ORD is something that I will never forget till today. While smoking he walked towards me and said;

""wah, going to ORD already ah..Ei, last time whatever happen between us I just want u to know ah, no hard feelings, don't later outside see me find problem with me ah hahahaha..""

I looked at him and smiled.

""guard duty they were sent to prowl alone instead of buddy level"" - Should not be happening at all. Prowling should always be done with a buddy. Even if we give the prowler's a walkie talkie, they still need buddy level in the event something happens. 

""assisted pull-ups they are still doing 3-man support holding the legs and back"" - When I left in 2022, this was still the correct practice. The safe practice for assisted pull ups, unless changed since I posted out, is one person for each leg, then one person behind. No jumping up onto the bar, must step up to the bar. 

""a safety pause was not called"" - Uh Oh...

As someone else said on your post though, asking on reddit and getting experiences from those serving or served, won't do anything to help those currently serving and going to serve.

You just OOCed and are awaiting PES before you can be posted out, no one wants to take responsibility for or train a temporary SIT. Let’s say they listen and send you to HQ BMTC III, then you also feel unfairly treated. Do they send you to another HQ? Cmon man think.

Those people have earned their admin time, some of it is a literal requirement for strenuous exercise. If they gave you MORE admin time who tf is going to want to stay in training. Cmon recoot think. Think dammit.

Back to the list of jobs you could get posted to next. While you are waiting which one of those do you THINK you can do? 

a. You can’t touch admin, your peers are still in training and their personals will be compromised by your eyes because you’re from the same batch, let alone the issue of teaching you admin.

b. Signals should be self explanatory

c. TO should be self explanatory

d. Congratulations you’ve arrived at the easiest choice by process of common sense. Supply.

As for how long PES will take. The board of MOs reconvene every end of month or so (?) to discuss PES matters, so that will take time even after getting a memo.

The SAF doesn't have a lot of regular units, so these units are kept sharpened to be the tip of the spear. 

There isn't a button that you can press and everything gets activated. There will always be escalation taken into account. Usually this will be in a form of a neighbouring politician ramping up the rhetoric against the city state. As more antagonistic propaganda rile up  the neighbouring native population, SAF will quietly increase its operation intensity. More naval ships start patrolling our waters, air force squadrons overseas get recalled back. ICT will focus on sofun, and unit training up to battalion level or further if applicable.

 You start seeing more reservists getting activated for mobilization, and maybe even see an open mobilization getting reported in the news. All our neighbours can see this, how we call reservists back in a few hours and armed them for operations. If you are in your ten year reservist cycle, you will comprise the majority of our fighting strength.

So what's your part in all of this? Ultimately it depends on the current phase of your training. Still in BMT?  Definitely won't be anywhere near the frontline. If you have completed up to company level training, then you'll be deemed ready. The smallest unit that can move out is a company, anything higher is just basically coordination and we leave it to the officers to sort it out. Operationally ready is just a term to say that your unit have completed all relevant training up to company level and is able to rotate into any similar combat arms unit.

 If there is an escalation of tensions, your unit will focus more on the ability to conduct operations. You won't be doing much PT, most of the time will be outfield so your unit can brush up on their SOP. There will be a specified schedule that your commanders will have to follow so that your unit will be deemed ready.",132,1743356273.0,Runningscrumhalf,NationalServiceSG

Anyways if we view it from the more layman pov and if u talked to some of the girls, tbvh u will be more pissed. At least the politicians give u a proper, sound reason, although whether it's fair to you is subjective.

don't buy into the facade that conscription solves the issue of inequality. it doesn't and the only reason is because nothing is fair in the first place. there are already different metrics of standards for one, and second, when it comes to social relations and stigma, there's another. it'll be a challenge to manage a full crowd of females who DO NOT want to be in the army.

You're not escaping these 2 years, and BMT is just the start of the two years. The faster you accept that this is your new life now, the easier it will be. Outside of your name and 4D (identification) number, you don't have an identity as far the PCs and above are concerned, you're just another recruit. Don't worry though, the earlier part of BMT up until field camp will be the most painful, every day will feel hard and when you see the routine order for the next day, it'll look even worse than the bad day you just had. After field camp, the rest of BMT is more relaxed, still regimented and sometimes shag but the worst is over.

Also, remember that most of your sergeants are also NSFs just like you and just want to ORD quickly and get it over with.

It’s kind of like a see saw, with more acceleration you need less bite. but the opposite won’t work on a slope because you don’t have enough power to sustain that bite. 

You can think about the clutch as like a lever controlling how hard two discs lock to each other. One disc is spinning (connected to the engine), the other disc is not moving (connected to the wheels). When you release the clutch, the discs come closer together, and the biting point is when these discs start to touch. But at the biting point, they don’t fully lock, it can slip a bit. 

if u release it too fast, the two discs completely lock to each other and the engine cannot start spinning the stationary wheels fast enough before locking up, making the engine speed drop too much which makes it stall. 

If you didn’t let go far enough to the biting point, the discs didn’t even touch, so the wheels are still free to spin as it’s not connected to the engine yet. 

So with more acceleration, it’s more forgiving since your engine speed will not drop too much to the point of stalling if you over released your clutch a little bit.",3,1743170605.0,Icywaterr,NationalServiceSG

I personally never saw myself as wayang as it meant to fake it, I did volunteer and share out of my own will and even money. I went far to regularly help out past any BMT evaluation phases, in SCS and even now in unit. But to others, it will seem like I am trying to show off, wayang or whatever. I would admit that what I did before especially in BMT was very possibly annoying. Maybe that’s why I didn’t end up in OCS. Only then I tuned down but I still regularly help out.

I have deuternopia - but guess what? I actually held jobs in QC doing wet chemistry because I can easily see titration endpoints where most people struggle. Yet, any course that has chemistry says no colour-blindness as a prerequisite.

Just look at the other comments here. Some saying you can't see the colour of the maroon beret. Utter ridiculous and just demeaning. Until recently, colour-blind people can't even take up a driving licence, yet many can see the traffic light colours better than most drivers.

2. Mine had 3 full platoons and 1 extra section. The training is honestly a joke if you don’t have major injuries, on runs the sergeants do push you but understand if you can’t keep a decent pace. Same goes for static exercises; they push you but understand if you can’t keep up, they were also quite nice about it; no shouting or direct scolding if you don’t portray a certain level of standards.

3. You get a decent amount of admin time, alot of time in between conducts because much training is cut out from the usual “curriculum” and minimally 2hrs before lights out. The exception would be before any high-key conducts like before outfield or BTP, where lights out is usually earlier. 

4. Not very sure, in my batch and the two before and after, we had Ninja and Kestrel.

5. As mentioned above, quite understanding about your conditions, but for non physical training like soldiering stuff, they still expect you not to be a complete idiot, i.e. there are still standards lol. I was from encik coy so understandably they were also more laidback.

i believe most of the pes b3/b4 consist of excused either rmj (running marching jumping), upper/lower limbs, so training i would say is easy. You guys are like snowflakes to the superiors, so during training if u feel any discomfort you are free to sit out anytime instead of getting forced to complete like the normal pes fit guys as all ur superior very scared of u getting injured. From what i can remember, my whole platoon excused rmj so we just lepak and walk instead of marching. for training, those who can run will run, those who can’t will walk rounds on the track field. There are some strength exercises where u lift dumbbells and another training called resilience package where theres like 5 stages of different exercises like push up, flutter kicks etc, after 30 seconds you will go onto the next stage and complete 1 whole round.  
For me i was excused rmj, so no CQB, SOC, throwing grenade and route march. For BTP, expect to leave coyline at 0700 and end past midnight, for me i reached back coyline at 0200 next day…
last but not least, outfield. you guys will be spending 4D3N instead of 5D4N cus pesb3/b4 no SIT test. on day 2, you guys will be digging shellscrape, since yall are pes b3/b4, 3-4 people will be assigned to digging one shellscrape and that’s all for your training.

Do expect a lot of admin time and a lot of welfares since yall are snowflakes, hence bring as much snacks to eat and chit chat

Depends what allergies you have but from what I saw most of them ate the same special diet (SD) ration. My bunkmates that were on SD honestly had it worse, because the dietary restrictions couldn’t be catered to each specific soldier, they had to eat the same boiled sauceless chicken thigh and plain rice everyday. It was quite sad to see and sometimes I switched my ration with them if they requested it lol (they claimed that they were barely allergic and made the mistake of declaring it). 
If you strongly know and feel that you have no more allergies or your reactions have become less severe to the point of being able to tolerate it; then don’t declare.

But if u are able to run, i would advice not to like overdo it if u get what i mean, cus your other batchmates cant run and they might see u as wayang and single u out which wont end well for u.

3. i don’t know how to reply to this but go through BMT with an open mind, your batchmates will be somewhat the same as you, confirm got a lot to talk about like how u guys ended up pes b3/b4 😂👍",4,1742915321.0,Icy-Wave-5618,NationalServiceSG

1a. can I assume that shooting range is a very controlled area and there won't be any injury? paiseh i'm quite paranoid since its real bullets;

1b. for BTP, does that mean there's no minimum requirement to pass or a certain number of shots u need to hit the target?

1c. what does ND & IA mean 😅 i'm quite unfamiliar with a lot of the abbreviations since i havent started yet

1d. tangent - in terms of PT, can I just push myself to an appropriate level (like how i'm training now to prepare myself; but its not so jialat also) without having to worry abt others thinking that i'm trying too hard? and will the sgts allow it or will they stop me cuz they might be scared of injury? cuz i kinda know my limits as well

2a. so PES B4 would be more of the ""unfit for B1 / not serious enough for C"" while high BMI make up more of those in PES B3? funny enough, i have no excuse for anything 😬

The most important thing is staying consistent, you must like or love running and doing endurance challenges. Especially important is finding someone or people to do it with, they will motivate you to keep going past tiredness or even exhaustion. Now for my training routine, I first warm up with 1km slow and easy to get my blood flowing, then 25-30 minutes of static stretches then dynamics (Let me know if you want the specifics) then go on a run 8-10km Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, these are relatively easy at a comfortable talking pace. Then two days a week either Tuesday, Thursday, or Sunday (I usually workout Tuesday and Thursday then I have a race on Saturday and use Sunday as my your rest day, depends on your soreness) I run a hard workout, I do the same warm up as the long runs, then a 6-9 Minute progression, either 2-2-2 or 3-3-3 (4:40 km pace -4:20 km pace - 4:00km pace) You can run any pace just make sure to speed up and get your blood really flowing. Now the workout will be some 800 meters or 400 meters (Ex. 2x800s followed by 4x400s, or like 4x800 2x400, two to three 1KM FARTLEKs are also good (Get more rest on these 4:00 - 5:00  minutes), X seconds on first bend then X+10 seconds on the jog (I do 30 then 40), no more than 6KM on workout days including progression, these should be really grindy, and you should feel tired after every two and like dreading the next, after each rep get a recovery of 2:30 - 3:00 minutes, but before that get your mind ready walking onto the starting line and go again, once you get past thinking you're so tired you can and WILL always finish your workout, always must have the mindset of ""Can I improve today?"" ""Am I willing to suffer a bit more today?"" Embrace the pain of tiredness. Then on easy long run days you can do three to four 200-300 meters on your race pace to get a feel of what you're gonna run. Other than that sleep and electrolytes are important, get electrolytes with magnesium and they will help you cramp much less, drink some 1-2 hours before the workout or in the morning after you wake up.

Tempos are great for the 5K, I'd get a good pace let's say you're aiming for 20:00 flat, try training / starting with 4:40 - 5:00 (Faster or slower depending on your fitness, the key is running a consistent pace then almost sprinting to the finish at the last about 0.5 KM, makes you get a sense to surge (go faster even when you're tired) minute per KM tempo for 5KM 2-3 times a week, for example, 
Mon: Tempo 
Tue: Long run, 
Wed: Tempo, 
Thur: Long run 
Fri: Short run or Long run or Tempo or Rest (Short run or rest if you want to do a straining tempo on Saturday)
Sat: Long run or Tempo 
Sun: Rest and Recover 
(Always watch your physical condition, any pains or worrying soreness don't push it, injury is worse than one or two rest days), the rest of the week get 8 -10 KM Long runs with Saturday or Sunday as your rest day. Once your fitness starts improving speed up those tempos or add a KM every tempo until you can hit 7-8 at your starting paces. Always remember to do stretches, dynamics and warm up (Easy 10-15 minutes jog comfortable pace) before your tempos and lighter stretches on long runs. It will get tiring, especially on the tempo's first one or two KM but push through that wall, stay consistent, and you can definitely run sub 20 minutes. Most importantly have fun, the 5K is my favorite event and I've made amazing memories there. Best of luck!

Here's some things you can do: 
Training: 
Run at least six days a week, be vigilant about your body so never push your body if somewhere  hurts when you stand or walk, take one or two days off if that happens and stretch gently. 


Now for my training schedule, you can adjust based off your fitness and lifestyle:


Before long and easy runs do a 800 meter warm up then static stretches and then dynamic stretches (Ask if you want the specifics),  


Before workouts, same warm up as above but lengthen dynamics and do a progression before track (interval) workouts, depending on your physical condition, try a 4 minute, 6 minute, or 9 minute progression. It can look like 1-1-2, 2-2-2, or 3-3-3 at paces 4:40-4:20-4:00 minute per KM. 


Monday: 
Hard workout, usually a ""double"" 
Tempo in the morning, 5-7 KM at a consistent, fast pace (Ex. 3:45 minute-per-km (MPKM)), then afternoon - late afternoon, intervals on the track. Depending on what you think you need to work on:
Speed: 16-20 200meters, in sets of four, so you do one, walk/jog back up to the starting line then do 4x200 meters and take a 2:30-3:00 minute recovery, and go again until 16 or 20 200 meters total.


Mental: One close to all out 800 meter (Let's say your PB is 2:30, you'll be running 2:35-2:40), 2-3 1KM FARTLEK (Fast on the first 200 meter then ten seconds slower on the next 200 meter and repeat until you do 3x200 meter fast and 2x200 slow, Ex. 35 fast then 45 slow. Then 2x600 meters, these can either be like the fartlek fast, slow, fast, or a consistent pace Ex. 5:00 MPKM flat. Go 3-4 minutes recovery on this and a minute less on the 600 meters, this is terrible you will dread going on the starting line right after the 800 meter, but push through and every time you do this workout you'll realize you have the ability to never stop, never give in to tireness you'll be faster, sharper, and even more mentally strong. 


Pacing: 4x800 / 8x400 or a mix of both, 2x800, 4x400, good if you want to be consistent racing the 2.4 KM, you have to hit set paces on every repetition with short recovery 1 to 2:25 minutes. EX. 2:30 consistent on the 800s, 69 consistent on 400s. 


Tuesday: Long run, walk jog pace, try to keep it consistent and avoid stopping as much as possible. Ex. 
8-10 KM at 5:00 MPKM 


Wednesday: Either easier workout or Long run depending on your soreness


Thursday: Have to do a workout by today or you can tune up for a ""race"" on Saturday, basically run 200 meters at your 2.4 KM race pace, Ex. 6x200 at 35 seconds pace which is 7:00 flat on 2.4K, helps you get a feel for your paces


Friday: Easy, very easy run 5KM max or don't even run at all, take it chill stretch and recover


Saturday: Either join an official 2.4K and test your fitness or do a 2.4K race on your own and get into the zone to run your hardest, try to PB Everytime you do this but if you don't PB in 2-3 weeks intervals during your months of training that's completely fine, the training is settling in and push hard and it'll be worth it 


Sunday: My Coach would always say if you ran a good race ""Put your legs up"" meaning you've worked hard this week and deserve the rest, I like seeing the sunrise so I will always go on an easy bike ride on these days but honestly, if you believe you've worked hard, which your mind and body will know. Rest up! And get ready for Monday!


Nutrition: Try not to eat so much processed food, once a week or so is okay but it really is horrible for your health, I'm talking about fast food, excess of processed sugars, candies and things like that. I do love using fruits, raw honey, and REAL maple syrup for my carbohydrates though, they have micronutrients, prebiotics, and minerals that definitely benefit you


Electrolytes: Drink a serving (1000 mg of salt, you'll need it, get one with magnesium as well) either in the morning or 1-2 hours before running / working out, some days you'll need two or even three servings depending on how hard you work, especially Mondays, so if you feel dehydrated get some electrolytes in. 


Sleep: The most important part of running, if you run so hard and don't get good sleep it is a straight path to injury, make sure you get eight hours of restful sleep a night, it is amazing and even when tough or give up starts to creep in, your sleep will give your body enough rest to push through that


Mental and Running partners: A lot of my mental to run has been built by my teammates, I absolutely appreciate and am grateful to them. When you understand that your teammate will never slow down and let go of your pace you will never let go. Try to find like minded people to push your physical limits with, if not you must find it in yourself, why do you want to run this goal? What is your purpose? How bad do you really want this? Are you ready to get into a dark place, where you will have to suffer more than other people to achieve this? If no, build it, you can do it! Realizing you can go through things that suck is so gratifying, and if yes, your mental is ready, go out and get it, Everytime you finish something difficult the next time you're even less likely to give up, build ambition, a fire that can burn the whole forest down! 


You got this! Ask if you need anything else, clarification or specifics! I believe in your grit and efforts! Thank you for reaching out and trying to improve yourself! Maybe I will see you during my IPPT as well, since mine is also in six months! ",1,1743265770.0,Technical-Shallot512,NationalServiceSG

Is it ok if I keep asking questions?

1. I’ve got a race pace of just about 5:50 min/km. How would that affect the times you mentioned before hand?

2. what did you mean by static stretches and dynamic stretches? I do some by default, but nothing too hard 

3. How many weeks for the results? Ig Im only asking so like if I don’t see time improvements then I don’t get discouraged very easily (just from past experience)

4. What did you mean by the mental workout and when did u do it (Which day)?

  
thanks so much? I think from this I’ll aim for a 9min 2.4 in abt 6 months. hopefully that’s practical…",2,1743373783.0,TheOracle1222,NationalServiceSG

While for intervals, they're fast, short, and you really feel the exhaustion after it or like the last 150-200 meters, for example 400 meter intervals, which is one lap on the track, if you do 6x400m at 2:30-3:00 recovery, you go fast, like 5-10 seconds faster than your 2.4K pace, for example, 64-66 (Which is around 10 seconds faster  than 7:35 pace, 75-76 seconds a lap)  this is the anaerobic part, where you're breathing and barely feel like you're getting oxygen, this builds up your short and explosive engine/tank (sprint capacity) (You can even test yourself with 1:00 minute recovery and slower 400 meters, for example I've done a 6x400 meter at 68-72 second paces with one minute recovery, then 4x200 meters at 30-32 with jogging to the start line recovery, feels terrible but really sharpens the mind, more of a mentality workout). For me track workouts require much more mental and getting ready for on the starting line, tell yourself you'll never quit, once you start your first lap, you go until you finish, for tempos they require much more focus, lock in your times, stay consistent and engaged and you will finish. Best of luck! Feel free to ask for anything else or specific! ",3,1743039407.0,Technical-Shallot512,NationalServiceSG

1. For times it is really feeling and trying to until you hit times that you push yourself like for me, tempo times is about about 10-15% slower than race pace so for 5:50 per KM, go 6:25-6:40 per KM for 5 KM, for the progression you can start with 7:00-6:40-6:20, and then gradually speed it up as your fitness improves. For the interval workouts on the track I am unsure, you must get a feel for all these intervals, the 1KM FARTLEK, 800 meter, and 400 meter, on separate days, try an all for all these distances (1KM FARKTLEK remember separated in 5 200 meters by fast-slow-fast-slow-fast, the pace is X speed for fast then X speed + 10) Try 10-20% slower on these as well, the most important thing is to find paces where you're uncomfortable and either almost or completely dreading the next repetition. I can give you more specific times once your know your maximum efforts. 


2. Static stretches are stretches where you're standing still to do, examples are toe touchers, groin (butterfly) stretch, hurdle stretches, sitting toe reaches, secretary stretch, I also like doing some arm + core workout at this time. First I'll do these stretches then do push ups in sets of 30 for 4 sets, or something like a BIG 13, it's 13 push ups, 13 sit ups, 12 push ups, 12 sit ups and so on all the way until one, it just gets your heart running, for core it's like V-ups, flutter kicks, chopstick kicks, scissors, waddles, boats, I think these are just names my Coach and team use but they're all things that engage the core, then a nice 3-5 minute plank to end it. Dynamics are standing walking and FAST stretches, I start putting my foot bent onto a fence or wall to stretch my ankles and calf then do dynamics with shimmer hugs for about 50 meters, then high kicks and touching your toe at the top, quick, sharp, high knees then striding/sprinting out for 50ish meters, then some butt kicks, high skips, open the gate, close the gate, and then step throughs, squats and going side to side, then raising ankle toe touchers, now you're ready for the long run or progression before a workout. 


3. By results I am going to guess you mean improving your 2.4 K time by even one second, if so you'll see results in a week, if you're working hard enough and managing your body (don't overtrain / overexert yourself for more than 3 days a week) getting your runs in consistently you will improve like light speed, fitness is vital in running but so much of it is your mentality, how much do you really want this thing? Even if you don't see this progress in 2-3 weeks, don't give in! Know that your body is trying to adjust to your training and it'll be worth it in the end! With this rigorous of training, always remember to take very good care of yourself by sleeping well and eating well. 


4. For the core/hard workout days usually I do them on Monday, you can allocate this hard workout based off what you think you need to work on after simulating racing the 2.4 K, for example, recall your race and see what is holding you back, do you start slowing down because your mind gives in before your body? (Do mental workout) Do your legs start slowing down and getting fatigued but your mind is still engaged or you are getting out too fast / slow ? (Pacing workout) Or is your step speed not there yet and you cannot get up to speed because of that? (Do the speed workout) Then you can pick between those workouts, however all of them somewhat go hand in hand but they will specialize on different aspects


I hope you can reach your goals! And do note the faster you get the exponentially harder it becomes, that is 100% normal, at some point speeding up by 1 or 2 seconds feels impossible but push through, stay consistent, and #1 TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! Best of luck man! ",2,1743394845.0,Technical-Shallot512,NationalServiceSG
